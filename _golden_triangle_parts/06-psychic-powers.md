## Psychic Phenomena

### Night Voice

#### Level 1: Whisper of Shadows
**Duration:** 1 minute  
**Description:** The psychic targets one creature within sight, planting an intrusive, otherworldly whisper in their mind and making them known to the Night. Those known to the Night are affected easier by other powers of the Night Voice, usually disadvantage on Saving Throws. The creature can make a Mental Effects save each round to shake off the debilitating effects. If the target fails their save, the Nightspeaker learns a fleeting fragment of their surface thoughts or memories.  
**Mechanics:** -1 on Skill Checks and -4 on attack rolls. Mark of the Night.  
**Upcast:** Add target an additional person per level.

#### Level 2: Void Resonance  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Description:** The psychic can manipulate gravitational forces in a 5-meter radius area, doubling or halving the local gravity. Those marked by Night are affected twice as strongly and sense the tendrils of Night pulling on them.  
**Mechanics:** Common sense.  
**Upcast:** Multiply the radius by levels upcast.

#### Level 3: Veil of Midnight
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Description:** The psychic creates a zone of complete silence, darkness and nullification of the Way within a 10-meter radius. All sound and light is absorbed, and psychic abilities cannot be used. Those marked by Night can now hear the whispers of the Night, even without Way ability.  
**Mechanics:** All sound and light within the area is nullified. Way powers cannot be activated or used within the area.  
**Upcast:** Multiply the radius by levels upcast.

#### Level 4: Night Cloak
**Duration:** Concentration, 10 minutes  
**Description:** The psychic can envelop themselves or an ally marked by Night in a cloak of darkness that absorbs light and sound, making the subject invisible and silent.  
**Mechanics:** The subject becomes invisible and gains a +4 bonus to Stealth checks. Any attacks made while cloaked have advantage. The cloak lasts for up to 10 minutes or until the subject attacks or takes damage.  
**Upcast:** Add one cloaked person per upcast.

#### Level 5: Hollow Chorus
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Description:** The psychic speaks to the Void and can momentarily increase gravitational forces on targets within a 10 meter sphere, causing intense pressure and damage. Targeting up to the Nightspeakers level of enemies. Those marked by Night take double the damage.  
**Mechanics:** Target must make a Physical saving throw or take d6 damage and be stunned for 1 round. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.  
**Upcast:** Add 10 meters to the sphere per level.

#### Level 6: Communion
**Duration:** Concentration, for 10 minutes  
**Description:** The Night Speaker engages in direct Communion with the Night, summoning an intangible presence that listens and responds. The surrounding darkness deepens and whispers echo from unseen depths. This presence can convey knowledge, reveal truths, or act as a subtle manipulator of reality.  
**Mechanics:** After the 10 minutes of communion the Night Speaker is granted a Boon in exchange for Stress. The strength of the boon determines the Stress.

**Examples:**
- "Who killed the merchant?" "A blade unsanctified by day, wielded by one who sees only shadows." (3 Stress)
- A shadowy servant emerges to perform a simple task, such as retrieving an object or barring a door for 1 turn (2 Stress)
- Create a permanent Mark of Night (4 Stress)
- The Night reaches through the veil to momentarily halt the advance of an enemy group (7 Stress)

**Upcast:** Instead of Upcasting, Communion's effects and costs can be offset by expanding the ritual of communion in length or offerings. For example communing during times of astrological importance or at convergences of planets.

#### Level 7: Lament of the Eternal Night
**Duration:** 1 minute  
**Description:** The Night Speaker removes their mask, their face creating a rift to the void that swallows light, sound, and hope. All within the rift experience a harrowing vision of their soul's judgment.  
**Mechanics:** Create a 20-meter radius rift centered on the Nightspeaker for 1 minute: All creatures within the rift must succeed on a Mental save each round or:
- Become frightened (1st failure)
- Be paralyzed (2nd failure)
- Collapse unconscious with psychic trauma (3rd failure)

The Nightspeaker and chosen allies marked by Night are unaffected and can move freely.
