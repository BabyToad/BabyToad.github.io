### Golden Triangle Ships

**The Red Horizon**  
**Class: Modified Free Merchant**  
Background Acquisition: Salvaged from the remains of a Maelstrom Corsair raid. The players, through clever negotiation and some under-the-table dealings with the Cobalt Syndicate, managed to secure this ship from a salvage yard on Lazuna. The ship has been repaired and slightly upgraded but still bears the scars of past battles.

**The Venture's Gambit**  
**Class: Retrofit Mining Ship**  
Background Acquisition: Acquired through a partnership with the 12 Finger Guilds, who needed reliable operatives to secure and transport rare minerals from Serambi. In return, the players received a decommissioned mining vessel, retrofitted for space travel and light combat.

**The Nusantaran Wind**  
**Class: Courier**  
Background Acquisition: This ship was a gift from a sympathetic faction within the Nusantaran Navy, appreciative of the crew's past assistance in handling pirate threats. It was transferred discreetly to avoid political backlash.

### Privateer Ships

**The Machina Virtus**  
**Class: Sentinel Corvette**  
The players acquired "Federation's Blade" through a clandestine deal with the Ispanian Federacion’s Tercio Cybernetica. They were instrumental in retrieving a lost experimental technology, and in return, they received the Corvette. The catch is that the ship has an embedded AI with loyalty protocols to the Ispanian Federacion, monitoring the players’ actions. They must occasionally undertake missions for the Tercio Cybernetica and ensure that the AI remains intact and unaltered, or face the risk of the AI taking control of the ship to return to its creators.

**The Lionheart's Fury:**  
**Class: Torpedo Corvette**  
"Lionheart's Fury" was acquired from the Anglois Dual Monarchy as a prize ship after the players aided in repelling an attack on a critical outpost. The catch is that the ship is still flagged as property of the Dual Monarchy, and the players must pay a hefty tithe from their earnings back to the monarchy as a form of "lease" for the vessel. Moreover, the players are expected to prioritize missions that align with the monarchy's interests and may be called upon to serve directly under its banner during times of conflict.

**The Caliphal Spear**  
**Class: Armed Freighter**  
The players obtained The Caliphal Spear through a lucrative contract with the Golden Triangle Trading Company. The company required skilled privateers to safeguard their assets and offered the corvette as part of the deal. However, the catch is that the ship technically remains the property of the Golden Triangle Trading Company, bound by stringent Sharia Law. This means the players must adhere to strict operational guidelines and report regularly to the company's overseers. Additionally, any profit made using the ship must be shared with the company, and they must avoid any actions that would contravene Sharia Law.

## The Harmony’s Edge

**Class: Small Carrier**  
The players obtained The Harmony's Edge through an arrangement with a powerful Cathayan mercenary company, the 14 Red Dogs. The company needed a reliable crew to operate the small carrier, which serves as both a transport and support vessel for their mercenary operations. However, this ties the players directly to the fortunes of the mercenaries.
