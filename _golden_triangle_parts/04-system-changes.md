## Advancement
Something that has always worked for sandbox games is pillar xp. I want to encourage players to interact with the sandbox but not prescribe a specific path.
Players should be rewarded

### Pillar XP

**Fortune**, you acquired a small fortune  
**Discovery**, you gained new useful, interesting or valuable information  
**Influence**, you convinced, swayed or influenced an important NPC  
**Trouble**, you escaped deathly trouble  
When one of the Pillars occurred during the session, gain 500xp. Gain double the xp, if the pillar occurred multiple times.

### Objectives

When you complete an objective, gain 2000-5000 xp.

**Examples:**

* Build an alliance with another faction (2000 XP)
* Acquire a genuine pretech artifact (3000 XP)
* Destroy a faction (4000 XP)
* Create a faction (3000 XP)
* Seize a Great Power prize (5000 XP)
* Collect the Raiments of Night (4000 XP)
* Open the Eye (5000 XP)
* Establish a Colony (3000 XP)

### Hit Dice Cap

Inflated HP pools take away tension and quick combat. Allowing players to rely on stats instead of skill and planning.

Starting at 6th level players can instead of gaining an extra HD, choose from 3 options:

#### Option 1: Gain a Wise [[Can you tell I like the Burning Wheel?]]
The character gains a Wise related to their experiences or background. A Wise is treated as a Level 1 Skill, granting +1 to related rolls.

**Examples:**
- **Warrior:** 5th Legion-wise, Dueling Customs-wise, Seven Holy Weapons-wise
- **Expert:** Ridiculous Request-wise, Starport Scuttlebutt-wise, Opulent Excess-wise
- **Psychic:** Eschatology-wise, Wayline Dynamics-wise, Insanity-wise

#### Option 2: Gain a Trait
Traits are narrative tools that offer rerolls in specific contexts. A character can invoke their Trait once per session to gain a reroll on a failed Skill Check.

**Examples:**
- **Unheeded:**
  - No one notices this character, or even remembers their name properly. Trait for avoiding attention or notice.
- **I Know This Ship Like My Own Hands:**
  - The spacer is a strange bloke, but they definitely know the ship. Trait for rerolling things related to fixing or finding things on the spacer's ship.
- **Imperious Demeanor:**
  - Use this trait to reroll social checks when dealing with anyone of lower station or rank.
- **Incomprehensible Diagnosis:**
  - Use this trait when trying to hide the true facts of a medical or technical diagnosis.
- **Wise Aphorisms:**
  - Use this for social skills if the player can come up with some appropriately sagacious dialogue to throw into play at the right moment.

#### Option 3: Raise an Ability Score
Gain +2 to any Ability Score or +1 to two Ability Scores (as per your original idea). Raising an Ability Score from 17 to 18 requires a +2.
