# The Golden Triangle

This is a living document compiling the Stars Without Number campaign setting and house rules I am using for my own gaming.
Things get changed, added, and removed as I run the campaign. But at anytime this document should represent the current state of the campaign setting. 
The document is intended to illustrate my design process and offer notes on why I made certain design decisions. Hopefully it will be useful to my future self and others.

It represents the closest approximation to my ideal flavor of science fiction. Something that is of course always a moving target, depending on my personal whims and the whims of the players.
But a few things are important to me:

No monoliths. It is factions all the way down. Every empire is made up of many smaller factions, each with their own agendas and interests.

Psychic powers are mystical. They defy all scientific inquirry. They are always viewed through a lens of religion. [[Test String for a sidenote.]]

A high density of interesting, exotic, and adventurous locations is improbable. But it is fun. The same goes for cultural differences.

No non-human intelligences. No aliens. No AI.
