description: An overview of the Golden Triangle campaign
---
The Golden Triangle is a campaign setting built for running a science fiction sandbox campaign using the orignal Stars Without Number rules.

It represents the closest approximation to my ideal flavor of science fiction. Something that is of course always a moving target, depending on my personal whims and the whims of the players.
But a few things are important to me:

No monoliths. It is factions all the way down. Every empire is made up of many smaller factions, each with their own agendas and interests.

Psychic powers are mystical. They defy all scientific inquirry. They are always viewed through a lens of religion. [[Test String for a sidenote.]]

A high density of interesting, exotic, and adventurous locations is improbable. But it is fun. The same goes for cultural differences.

No non-human intelligences. No aliens. No AI.
