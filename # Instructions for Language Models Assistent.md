# Instructions for Language Models Assisting with My Website Development

## Introduction

I am a game designer specializing in video games and tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). I am embarking on a project to create my personal website, drawing significant inspiration from [gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/). While I intend to infuse my own style and personality into the site, I highly appreciate the core design principles of gwern.net and aim to adopt similar concepts.

This document serves as a reference and context for language models like GPT-4, Sonnet, or future LLMs. Whenever I seek assistance or ask questions related to this project, please utilize the information provided here to offer intelligent and relevant support.
