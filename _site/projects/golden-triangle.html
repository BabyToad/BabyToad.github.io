<p>This is a living document compiling the Stars Without Number campaign setting and house rules I am using for my own gaming.
Things get changed, added, and removed as I run the campaign. But at anytime this document should represent the current state of the campaign setting. 
The document is intended to illustrate my design process and offer notes on why I made certain design decisions. Hopefully it will be useful to my future self and others.</p>

<p>It represents the closest approximation to my ideal flavor of science fiction. Something that is of course always a moving target, depending on my personal whims and the whims of the players.
But a few things are important to me:</p>

<p>No monoliths. It is factions all the way down. Every empire is made up of many smaller factions, each with their own agendas and interests.</p>

<p>Psychic powers are mystical. They defy all scientific inquirry. They are always viewed through a lens of religion. <span class="sidenote-anchor">Test String for a sidenote.</span></p>

<p>A high density of interesting, exotic, and adventurous locations is improbable. But it is fun. The same goes for cultural differences.</p>

<p>No non-human intelligences. No aliens. No AI.</p>

<h3 id="stress">Stress</h3>

<p><strong>How do I gain Stress?</strong><br />
There is also a number of other ways to get stress such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Critically failing a roll.</em></li>
  <li><em>Failing a saving throw.</em></li>
  <li><em>Failing a save when witnessing psychic phenomena.</em></li>
  <li><em>Facing deathly trouble.</em></li>
  <li><em>Any time you or your ship takes the first hit.</em></li>
  <li><em>Certain creatures or enemies.</em></li>
  <li><em>Getting knocked unconscious.</em></li>
  <li><em>Going 24 hours without rest.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How do I relieve Stress?</strong><br />
Getting rid of Stress is a lot like regular recovery.<br />
A full day of rest recovers 1 Stress. If the character has access to pills, gambling or other vices they reduce 1 Stress additionally.<br />
If the character is being attended by someone with the Religion, Artist or Psychology skill they recover an additional two Stress per skill level of the attendant.<br />
Additionally circumstances that may reduce Stress:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Escaping deathly trouble.</li>
  <li>Docking at a safe harbor.</li>
  <li>Festivals, rituals, birthdays or celebrations.</li>
  <li>Earning a deeds point.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What happens when I max out my Stress?</strong><br />
Save against your Stress. If you fail, roll on the Panic table.</p>

<p><strong>The Red Horizon</strong><br />
<strong>Class: Modified Free Merchant</strong><br />
Background Acquisition: Salvaged from the remains of a Maelstrom Corsair raid. The players, through clever negotiation and some under-the-table dealings with the Cobalt Syndicate, managed to secure this ship from a salvage yard on Lazuna. The ship has been repaired and slightly upgraded but still bears the scars of past battles.</p>

<p><strong>The Venture’s Gambit</strong><br />
<strong>Class: Retrofit Mining Ship</strong><br />
Background Acquisition: Acquired through a partnership with the 12 Finger Guilds, who needed reliable operatives to secure and transport rare minerals from Serambi. In return, the players received a decommissioned mining vessel, retrofitted for space travel and light combat.</p>

<p><strong>The Nusantaran Wind</strong><br />
<strong>Class: Courier</strong><br />
Background Acquisition: This ship was a gift from a sympathetic faction within the Nusantaran Navy, appreciative of the crew’s past assistance in handling pirate threats. It was transferred discreetly to avoid political backlash.</p>

<h3 id="privateer-ships">Privateer Ships</h3>

<p><strong>The Machina Virtus</strong><br />
<strong>Class: Sentinel Corvette</strong><br />
The players acquired “Federation’s Blade” through a clandestine deal with the Ispanian Federacion’s Tercio Cybernetica. They were instrumental in retrieving a lost experimental technology, and in return, they received the Corvette. The catch is that the ship has an embedded AI with loyalty protocols to the Ispanian Federacion, monitoring the players’ actions. They must occasionally undertake missions for the Tercio Cybernetica and ensure that the AI remains intact and unaltered, or face the risk of the AI taking control of the ship to return to its creators.</p>

<p><strong>The Lionheart’s Fury:</strong><br />
<strong>Class: Torpedo Corvette</strong><br />
“Lionheart’s Fury” was acquired from the Anglois Dual Monarchy as a prize ship after the players aided in repelling an attack on a critical outpost. The catch is that the ship is still flagged as property of the Dual Monarchy, and the players must pay a hefty tithe from their earnings back to the monarchy as a form of “lease” for the vessel. Moreover, the players are expected to prioritize missions that align with the monarchy’s interests and may be called upon to serve directly under its banner during times of conflict.</p>

<p><strong>The Caliphal Spear</strong><br />
<strong>Class: Armed Freighter</strong><br />
The players obtained The Caliphal Spear through a lucrative contract with the Golden Triangle Trading Company. The company required skilled privateers to safeguard their assets and offered the corvette as part of the deal. However, the catch is that the ship technically remains the property of the Golden Triangle Trading Company, bound by stringent Sharia Law. This means the players must adhere to strict operational guidelines and report regularly to the company’s overseers. Additionally, any profit made using the ship must be shared with the company, and they must avoid any actions that would contravene Sharia Law.</p>

<h2 id="the-harmonys-edge">The Harmony’s Edge</h2>

<p><strong>Class: Small Carrier</strong><br />
The players obtained The Harmony’s Edge through an arrangement with a powerful Cathayan mercenary company, the 14 Red Dogs. The company needed a reliable crew to operate the small carrier, which serves as both a transport and support vessel for their mercenary operations. However, this ties the players directly to the fortunes of the mercenaries.</p>

<h3 id="night-voice">Night Voice</h3>

<h4 id="level-1-whisper-of-shadows">Level 1: Whisper of Shadows</h4>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The psychic targets one creature within sight, planting an intrusive, otherworldly whisper in their mind and making them known to the Night. Those known to the Night are affected easier by other powers of the Night Voice, usually disadvantage on Saving Throws. The creature can make a Mental Effects save each round to shake off the debilitating effects. If the target fails their save, the Nightspeaker learns a fleeting fragment of their surface thoughts or memories.<br />
<strong>Mechanics:</strong> -1 on Skill Checks and -4 on attack rolls. Mark of the Night.<br />
<strong>Upcast:</strong> Add target an additional person per level.</p>

<h4 id="level-2-void-resonance">Level 2: Void Resonance</h4>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The psychic can manipulate gravitational forces in a 5-meter radius area, doubling or halving the local gravity. Those marked by Night are affected twice as strongly and sense the tendrils of Night pulling on them.<br />
<strong>Mechanics:</strong> Common sense.<br />
<strong>Upcast:</strong> Multiply the radius by levels upcast.</p>

<h4 id="level-3-veil-of-midnight">Level 3: Veil of Midnight</h4>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The psychic creates a zone of complete silence, darkness and nullification of the Way within a 10-meter radius. All sound and light is absorbed, and psychic abilities cannot be used. Those marked by Night can now hear the whispers of the Night, even without Way ability.<br />
<strong>Mechanics:</strong> All sound and light within the area is nullified. Way powers cannot be activated or used within the area.<br />
<strong>Upcast:</strong> Multiply the radius by levels upcast.</p>

<h4 id="level-4-night-cloak">Level 4: Night Cloak</h4>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The psychic can envelop themselves or an ally marked by Night in a cloak of darkness that absorbs light and sound, making the subject invisible and silent.<br />
<strong>Mechanics:</strong> The subject becomes invisible and gains a +4 bonus to Stealth checks. Any attacks made while cloaked have advantage. The cloak lasts for up to 10 minutes or until the subject attacks or takes damage.<br />
<strong>Upcast:</strong> Add one cloaked person per upcast.</p>

<h4 id="level-5-hollow-chorus">Level 5: Hollow Chorus</h4>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The psychic speaks to the Void and can momentarily increase gravitational forces on targets within a 10 meter sphere, causing intense pressure and damage. Targeting up to the Nightspeakers level of enemies. Those marked by Night take double the damage.<br />
<strong>Mechanics:</strong> Target must make a Physical saving throw or take d6 damage and be stunned for 1 round. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.<br />
<strong>Upcast:</strong> Add 10 meters to the sphere per level.</p>

<h4 id="level-6-communion">Level 6: Communion</h4>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, for 10 minutes<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The Night Speaker engages in direct Communion with the Night, summoning an intangible presence that listens and responds. The surrounding darkness deepens and whispers echo from unseen depths. This presence can convey knowledge, reveal truths, or act as a subtle manipulator of reality.<br />
<strong>Mechanics:</strong> After the 10 minutes of communion the Night Speaker is granted a Boon in exchange for Stress. The strength of the boon determines the Stress.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“Who killed the merchant?” “A blade unsanctified by day, wielded by one who sees only shadows.” (3 Stress)</li>
  <li>A shadowy servant emerges to perform a simple task, such as retrieving an object or barring a door for 1 turn (2 Stress)</li>
  <li>Create a permanent Mark of Night (4 Stress)</li>
  <li>The Night reaches through the veil to momentarily halt the advance of an enemy group (7 Stress)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Upcast:</strong> Instead of Upcasting, Communion’s effects and costs can be offset by expanding the ritual of communion in length or offerings. For example communing during times of astrological importance or at convergences of planets.</p>

<h4 id="level-7-lament-of-the-eternal-night">Level 7: Lament of the Eternal Night</h4>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The Night Speaker removes their mask, their face creating a rift to the void that swallows light, sound, and hope. All within the rift experience a harrowing vision of their soul’s judgment.<br />
<strong>Mechanics:</strong> Create a 20-meter radius rift centered on the Nightspeaker for 1 minute: All creatures within the rift must succeed on a Mental save each round or:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Become frightened (1st failure)</li>
  <li>Be paralyzed (2nd failure)</li>
  <li>Collapse unconscious with psychic trauma (3rd failure)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Nightspeaker and chosen allies marked by Night are unaffected and can move freely.</p>
