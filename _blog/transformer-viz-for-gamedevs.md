I recently gave a talk about AI for Game Developers, and I wanted to create something that would help visualize how transformer neural networks actually work. While transformers are incredibly powerful, their inner workings can be quite abstract and hard to grasp.

## The Interactive Demo

I've created an interactive visualization [[Shoutout to Claude for helping.]] that you can try out right now:

[Try the Transformer Visualization Demo](/transformer-viz)

The demo shows how a transformer network processes different words through its layers, revealing the semantic transformations that occur. You can switch between different words (CAT, DOG, LION, CAR) to see how the network handles different concepts.

## What's Happening in the Visualization?

The visualization shows three key layers of a transformer network:

1. **Layer 5 (Mid-level concepts)**: Here you'll see basic semantic features being activated
2. **Layer 12 (High-level concepts)**: More complex patterns emerge
3. **Layer 20 (Abstract concepts)**: The network has formed rich, abstract representations

Each layer transforms the input in a meaningful way, building up increasingly complex representations. The bars in the visualization represent different features or dimensions that the network has learned to recognize.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fixed Transformations**: The network applies the same learned transformations to every input, but produces different patterns based on the input
2. **Emergent Meaning**: Similar concepts (like CAT and LION) activate similar patterns without explicit programming
3. **Hierarchical Processing**: Each layer builds more abstract representations, from basic features to complex concepts
4. **Distributed Knowledge**: Meaning isn't stored in one place - it's distributed across many dimensions

## Try It Yourself

The visualization is designed to be interactive and intuitive. Try switching between different words to see how the network handles different concepts. Notice how:

- Similar concepts (CAT/LION) activate similar patterns
- Different concepts (CAT/CAR) show completely different patterns
- The patterns become more abstract and meaningful in deeper layers

This visualization is just a simplified model of how real transformer networks work, but it captures the key concepts in a way that's accessible to game developers. Understanding these patterns can help you better integrate AI into your games and development workflow.
