[Obsidian Archive](/projects/obsidian-archive/) is a Chrome extension that archives web pages to your Obsidian vault with rich metadata for search and citation. One click saves any article, tweet, or page as a well-formatted markdown file.

I am having a jolly good time tinkering with Claude Code over the holidays.

Sometime in 2024 I started the habit of keeping all my notes as markdown files and storing them in an Obsidian Vault in anticipation of better LLMs, which is now starting to pay off. With Opus 4.5 and Claude Code you can have a lot of fun building custom tools and automating little things.

The Obsidian Vault with the markdown files serves as an easily searchable, context-rich environment that I can plug into any LLM and get going.

That Context (my archives containing .md, pdfs, and other LLM readable stuff) plus Scaffolding (Claude Code, Custom Extensions, Scripts, Skills, Custom instructions) make the LLM vastly more effective and capable.

Claude Code and Opus 4.5 are so much fun to do things with. Thinking about what you can automate and will be able to automate in the future is fun. What to prepare and what systems to put in place for continuing AI capabilities continues to pay off.
