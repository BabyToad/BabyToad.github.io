## The Gilded Bastion
Every lunar cycle the 12 Finger Guilds transport refined transplutonics and other rate raw materials to the zero-g forges of the Lazunan shipyards.
The cargo is protected by a ancient and venerable armored cruiser. The Gilded Bastion is a ship of the olden days, a relic of the days of the old empire. Closer to a orbital fortress than a ship, the Gilded Bastion protects the crucial mineral exports of the 12 Finger Guilds.

## The Vault
At the heart of the Gilded Bastion sits the Vault. A repository storing vast wealth, for trade with the Urbanites of Javon.
It is build to be entirely independant of the ship, and designed to withstand a siege for years. In the event of a siege, the Vault can be sealed off and jetisoned from the rest of the ship, awaiting reinforcement.
The Vault is guarded by a Venerable Shaper, a master artificer of the 12 Finger Guilds. And a contigent of Ore Wardens, a group of 12 elite warriors.
Even if the Vault is breached, intruders must first pass through the Chamber of the Turtle. Here all movement is halved, converging in a geometric series.

## The Chamber of the Turtle
A large vaulted chamber with cables and conduits converging in the center. When the Chamber is activated, all movement is halved, converging in a geometric series.
Light shifts to a deep red, and the temperature drops. The effect is strongest in the center of the chamber, which is pitch black as no light can return.
At the center of the chamber sits a jump gate fragment. The calculations of the Cryoarithmetic Engine are fed into the fragment, stabilizing the jump field. Thereby opening a meta-dimensional tunnel to the heart of the Nusantaran star. The massive amount of heat in turn powers the Cryoarithmetic Engine.


## Cryoarithmetic Engine
The Cryoarithmetic Engine is a archeotechdevice that generates processing power by drawing heat from the ambient surrounding. The compute generated thus scales logarithmically with heat.
Siphoning the entropy/heat from the star powers the cryoarithmetic engine, which in turns supplies the compute to stabilize the tunnel.

The Venerable Shaper is conducting experiments into both the engine and the jump gate fragment.
They have notice that the more energy they supply the stronger the time-dilation effect of the engine becomes. The large the temperature gradient, the stronger the geometric decay of velocity. This means that as energy supplied approaches infinity the velocity decay factor approaches 0. At infinite energy there is no more movement.

The higher the entropy of the system, the stronger the velocity decay. This also means that cold things are not slowed as strongly as hot things.

The Venerable Shaper has devised special ammunition for the Guardians of the Engine. They use highly ordered crystals with low entropy, like sapphires, diamonds and quartz.

## The Guardians of the Engine
**Venerable Shaper (4HD)**  
*Equipment:*
- Grav-halberd (can lift/throw objects at range, targets save vs Tech)
- Rotary Revolver with Diamond Bullets
- Artificer Armor with Integrated Force Fields

**Ore Warden (2HD)**  
*Equipment:*
- Heavy Exo-Armor
- Mag-Hammers (d10 damage, heavy)
- Integrated Power Tools
- Plasma Cutter Rifle

**Pyrocophagus**
- By super heating and entropy maximizing a sarcophagus, time can be slowed to a grinding halt. Forever preserving the entombed.
