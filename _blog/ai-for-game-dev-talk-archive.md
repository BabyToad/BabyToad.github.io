I gave a talk at Nerdicon about using AI practically in game development - focusing on the mundane but genuinely useful applications rather than the hype. This post serves as an archive and resource hub for that presentation.

## Core Concept: Mundane Utility

The talk focused on AI's practical applications for indie game developers - the boring but essential tasks that AI handles well today. No promises of AGI or creative breakthroughs, just tools that save time on repetitive work.

## Practical AI Use Cases for Game Development

### Content Generation & Validation
- **Text Generation**: Lore variations, dialog snippets, tooltips, item descriptions
- **Localization**: Quick translation drafts for multiple languages
- **Style Validation**: Checking if content matches your game's tone and theme
- **Synthetic Focus Groups**: Testing content reception at scale

### Code & Technical Tasks
- **Code Completion**: GitHub Copilot for routine programming tasks
- **Documentation**: Automated API docs and code comments
- **Bug Discovery**: Generate 50 edge cases for feature testing
- **Pseudocode Generation**: Turn design specs into implementation outlines

### Production Efficiency
- **Asset Organization**: Batch renaming and labeling of game assets
- **Placeholder Assets**: Quick generation via Meshy AI (with manual fixes)
- **Animation Prototypes**: DeepMotion for rough animation passes

### Design & Analysis
- **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explain your design problems to AI
- **Statistical Analysis**: Models excel at finding patterns in playtesting data
- **Balance Testing**: Simulate thousands of combat scenarios (see Lancer example)
- **Design Document Processing**: Transform natural language specs into state machines

### Marketing & Business
- **Store Page Copy**: Steam descriptions and feature lists
- **Devlog Writing**: Draft updates and patch notes
- **Social Media Content**: Platform-specific promotional text

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI is a prediction engine** - It excels when working close to its training data
2. **Context is everything** - The more specific context you provide, the better the output
3. **Manage it like a smart intern** - Clear instructions, review output, iterate with feedback
4. **Use the right tool**: 
  - Hard problems = Reasoning models (Claude Opus, GPT-o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro)
  - Simple tasks = Cheaper, faster models

## The Future is Already Here

- AI costs are dropping 10x every year
- Current capabilities are the worst they'll ever be
- New features coming: better agents, test-time compute, fine-tuning

The message: **Use the dang thing.** Pick a benchmark task you're good at, test AI against it, and integrate it where it helps.
