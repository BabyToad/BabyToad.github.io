# The Lunar Liches of Selena-Resht


Janat al-Ardh is called paradise. You can feel it in the water. You can feel it in the earth. You can feel it in the air. A perfect Eden forged by pretech engineering and imbued with eternal grace. It's people shaped from the very fabric of the universe.

The world changed since that golden age of humanity. The Scream sundered the great realms of man and Janat al-Ardh closed it's gates.

Overtime some of paradises people came to be resentful of this seclusion. They sought to leave  and reclaim the great realms of yore. For after all, they were made perfect and eternal, and theirs was the rightful dominion over all of creation.

They left for the moon to muster a great host of angels. Yet when they arrived and their armies had reclaimed the ancient ruins from mutant barbarians, they realized their folly. Removed from the grace of Janat al-Ardh, they were no longer eternal. Enraged at their mortality and flaw, they returned to make war on Janat al-Ardh. But they could not break into paradise again.

Now they dwell in the outer system, determined to live forever and reclaim their place in heaven. The technological marvels of the golden age now used to prolong and cling to life at all cost.

They call themselves Asqaiâ€™elun, it means the Drawn Shadows.

Selene-Resht, the Moon
The Gate, the dormant gate
The Tears, shattered remains of the second moon

## Orbital Liches

- Geneticists who reside on the moon.
- Formerly part of the paradise, now fallen from its grace.
- Mortals sustained by unnatural, necromantic means after severing their connection to Janat al-Ardh.
- Goal:
	- conquest of Paradise
	- to live forever
	- to pursue knowledge and enlightenment no matter the prize


Cool shit:
- bone pipers, fused bodies playing orchestral piping sounds on their own bones
- a guy just covered in wax candles
- riding a floating snail palanquin
- super fat, but with long spider limbs, towering above everyone
- floating brains like cherubimb attached by cables
- giganctic funeral bells ringing with balefull psychic bellows, hanging out of the grey cloud cover, actually dropping grey spore clouds as they ring
