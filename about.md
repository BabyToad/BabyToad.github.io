# About Me

I'm a game developer with a passion for creating open dynamic systems. My work focuses on building games that teach you how to think, or at the very least, teach you to question your assumptions.

Right now I'm helping people and companies make better use of information and education using game design principles: [PlayInsight Studio](https://playinsightstudios.com/).

Beyond that, I've been designing and running roleplaying games for over 10 years, which occasionally results in essays on design theory and my own attempted contributions to the field.

## Current Focus

I am currently building my company PlayInsight Studios and working on [Endstation](/projects/endstation), a narrative game about adventure at the end of the known universe.
