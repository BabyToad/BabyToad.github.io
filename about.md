# About Me

I'm a game developer with a passion for creating open dynamic systems. My work focuses on building games that teach you how to think, or at the very least, question your assumptions.

## Background

I graduated from the Macromedia University Leipzig with a Bachelor's degree in Game Design and Development. I'm now making serious games with my company [PlayInsight Studio](https://playinsightstudios.com/).

Beyond that, I've been designing and running roleplaying games for over 10 years, which occasionally results in essays on design theory and my own attempted contributions to the field.

## Current Focus

I am currently building my company PlayInsight Studios and working on [Endstation](/projects/endstation), a narrative game about adventure at the end of the known universe.
