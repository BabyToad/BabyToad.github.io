- Shine (in dragon form) gives Phoenix a mission:
    - Seek out another dragon near Lake Mysterium, Aradon, Far East.
    - Three questions to ask: How did they get here? Why are they hiding? Will they challenge Shine for rulership of Arcadia?
    - Phoenix is given 200 gold for expenses; must return unused funds.
- Phoenix respectfully accepts and collects the gold from Shine’s hoard.

---

## Scene 3: Planning the Journey

- Phoenix considers travel options:
    - Overland route preferred for low profile.
    - Route: Dragon Peak → Crownhold → Thaben → Dawngate → Tassel (by boat), then overland.
    - Boat fares: 6 gold total to Tassel.
    - Phoenix travels incognito but is recognized in some places due to cultist robes.
    - Arrives in Tassel, a ruined, bandit-infested town with some resettlement.

---

## Scene 4: Tassel – Tavern Encounter

- Phoenix enters the tavern, interacts with the tough, armed barkeep (middle-aged woman).
- Pays 1 gold for drinks; receives change and two drinks.
- Young tough (“Bones” aka “the Butcher”) approaches Phoenix, sizing him up.
- Phoenix preemptively casts Charm Person (pass, natural 3 on save); Bones becomes friendly.
- Bones shares rumors:
    - Lake Mysterium is creepy, people go missing, whispers of a hag.
    - Advises against traveling through Tetherwilds; suggests following the river from Shirebrook.
- Phoenix decides not to bring Bones along; spends the night in Tassel (1 gold).

---

## Scene 5: Overland to Cauldron

- Phoenix travels to Cauldron via West Road (2 days, 39 miles).
- No encounters; passes farmers, arrives in damaged but resettling Cauldron.
- Pays for food, lodging, and rations (1 gold).
- Gathers rumors (successful Charisma check):
    - Noble family rebuilding Thornwood with bricklayers.
    - The “Wraith of the Tetherwilds” rumored to be back, taking souls near Cauldron.

---

## Scene 6: Through Misty Rapids and Thornwood

- Phoenix avoids Misty Rapids (ruined, dangerous, wild dogs, bandit cover).
- Moves quickly through to Thornwood.
- **Combat Encounter:** Ambushed by two ogres in Thornwood Forest.
    - Initiative: Phoenix wins.
    - Casts Scare (affects one ogre, who flees); second ogre attacks but misses (AC 14).
    - Phoenix casts Scare again (double MP cost, 12 MP); second ogre flees.
    - Phoenix avoids combat, circles around, and continues.
- Arrives at Thornwood, now a worksite with 60 laborers and 6 knights.
- No tavern; Phoenix moves on after brief interaction.

---

## Scene 7: East Road and Black Pine Marsh

- Travels along East Road, skirting Black Pine Marsh (dangerous, unnavigable).
- **Random Encounter:** As Phoenix makes camp, feels ground tremors—Hydra attack!
    - Not surprised due to tremors.
    - Hydra appears 230 feet away; Phoenix flees, easily outpaces hydra (Hydra is slower).
    - Rolls a natural 20 to avoid losing any gear during the escape.
    - Camps elsewhere, regains MP.

---

## Scene 8: Shirebrook Ruins and River Crossing

- Reaches Shirebrook: completely destroyed, bodies gathered but not buried.
- No living inhabitants; Phoenix notes the grim scene for Shine.
- Needs to cross the river; no bridges remain.
- Uses Swimming proficiency (pass) to cross at the river mouth (dangerous currents).
- Now in the woods, two days from Lake Mysterium.

---

## Scene 9: The Hag by the Crystal Run

- Phoenix follows the river; encounters an old woman (hag) at a hut by the river, roasting rabbit.
- Perception check: Notices shrunken heads, woven plant “mirror,” other ominous signs.
- Casts Charm Person (uncertain if it works), then Detect Evil (strong evil detected).
- Hag warns Phoenix not to go to Lake Mysterium—“he” (many-eyed, many-armed beast) lurks there.
- Hag reveals she and her daughters are “gate guards” for the dragon.
- Phoenix negotiates safe passage; hag agrees if he answers her questions.
- Hag’s daughter, Melody (small, moderately evil), joins.
- They guide Phoenix toward the dragon’s lair, traveling overnight with a lantern of glowing bugs.

---

## Scene 10: The Shadow Dragon’s Lair

- At dawn, they reach a cave in the mountains—entrance to the shadow dragon’s lair.
- Phoenix feels the “marked territory” of the dragon (tingling, gut feeling).
- Hag reveals she has a dozen daughters, only two live with her.
- Phoenix enters the cave alone; hags wait outside.
- **Dragon Encounter:** Experiences dragon fear (save vs. petrification at -4).
- The shadow dragon, “Flicker,” appears—smaller than Shine, but more powerful, translucent cobalt-blue/black scales.
- Demands Phoenix show his dragon scale mask.
- Phoenix presents the mask, introduces himself as Shine’s emissary.
- Asks three questions:
    1. How did you get here? (Aided by Malkus, god of chaos/canyons/echoes.)
    2. Why are you hiding? (“I say thrive, not hide. The golds are halfbreeds, corrupted by mortals.”)
    3. Will you challenge Shine? (“I could crush her, but I pity her. Tell her she’s lost her way.”)
- Dragon implies Shine is “more mortal than dragon,” calls her a “halfbreed.”
- Phoenix, terrified, asks if there’s any message to convey; Flicker says Shine should come herself if she wants to treat “one superior being to a less superior being.”
- Phoenix leaves, hags escort him back to Shirebrook.

---

## Scene 11: Return and Debrief

- Phoenix reflects on the gravity of his quest, feeling out of his depth but determined.
- Returns to Shine’s lair, delivers a full debrief (successful memory check: natural 18, modified 33).
- Shine’s only follow-up: asks if Phoenix saw any sign of hatchlings/children near the shadow dragon (Phoenix reports only hags, no dragon children).
- Shine muses on the implications; expresses concern if Flicker has offspring.
- Session ends with Phoenix’s successful mission and the realm’s uncertain future.

## Notes for Next Session

- Shine may wish to investigate further regarding Flicker’s possible offspring or the hags’ true nature.
- The political and metaphysical implications of a shadow dragon aided by a god are significant.
- The realm remains unstable: ruined towns, supernatural threats, and shifting power dynamics.
- Phoenix’s role as emissary may expand, especially if Shine seeks direct parley with Flicker.
- Open threads: the hags’ intentions, the fate of Thornwood, the Wraith of the Tetherwilds, and the ongoing resettlement of the region.

---

**Cliffhanger/Session End:**  
Phoenix returns with grave news: Flicker is powerful, disdainful of Shine, and possibly plotting. The balance of power among dragons—and the fate of Arcadia—hangs in the balance.

---

**Ready for next session:**
- Shine’s reaction to Flicker’s message.
- Further investigation into the hags and possible shadow dragon progeny.
- Potential for direct dragon-to-dragon diplomacy or conflict.
- Continued exploration of the ruined and rebuilding lands of Arcadia.
