## Transcript


**[00:00]**
Hello, everybody, and welcome to Dicen with Dev.

How are you doing, Ryan?

Doing well.

I'm so excited to play D&D.

It has been, I don't even know, a year since I last played this character?

It's been 364 days.

I saw somewhere earlier today that it was June 25th last year.

It's like we did that on purpose.

Almost.

Maybe someone should get married every year at this time, and then we can always play


**[00:32]**
some D&D.

All right, so, Fen, not Fenric, that's a different character, Phoenix.

You are Phoenix.

You are a warlock of a great and powerful dragon.

You want to, for the people who haven't seen or who it's been a year since they've seen,

do you want to tell us a little bit about Phoenix, if you remember anything about Phoenix?


**[01:02]**
Well, it has been, well, it hasn't been a year since I last played, so I should remember

a thing or two.

At least I have a character sheet, and it looks pretty sick.

So Phoenix is a rebuild warlock, yeah, I don't know what else to say, an acolyte of


**[01:36]**
radiance?

Yes.

Yeah.

A great gold dragon.

Absolutely.

Why is Phoenix a supplicant to this dragon?

What?

Supplicant.

Okay.

That's a vocabulary word.

A serpent?

Servant?

I don't know.

Servant?

A savant?

Phoenix is, yeah, a man reborn.


**[02:11]**
He's a war refugee from Mystria, a victim of Scoria's regime.

He has the all-too-visible scars and burns to show for that.


**[02:42]**
Terrible, terrible damage.

Yeah.

Phoenix is not, it was his, yeah, this is, whatever, name, name, it's his, yeah, he knows

what a, yeah, anyways, before that, go ahead, sorry, no, no, no, that's, yeah, that's, yeah,

ellipsis?

Is that what that's called?

Yes.

Ellipsis.

Great.


**[03:12]**
So last session, you had been dealing with a knight in and around Tassel, and you'd gone

back.

Yeah.

A dark, yeah, a dark knight, I don't know, fall of a knight, I don't know, yeah, yeah,

Oathbreaker.

Yep.

So, like, delivery message and exited the vicinity.

And we're gonna pick up with Phoenix two years and one level later, because you can't just


**[03:46]**
Another, another level?

I'm level two at the moment.

Yes.

Are we leveling to three?

Yes.

Explaining why I'm level two.

Okay.

We're gonna jump to level three, because it's been two years, and it only makes sense that

you are.

Okay, timeskip.

Yeah.

Alright, shall I just mark that immediately, or do I need to do any exposition?

Mark it immediately.

We'll leave two years.

Wait, are you gonna work for my XP?

You're getting soft, Neil.

I'm getting old, I'm getting soft, time is slipping.


**[04:19]**
I didn't even get to play.

I'll take the HP.

I feel like the spells I got at level two were pretty powerful.

Three should unlock second level spells, right?

Yes, it will unlock second level spells.

Let's roll for HP first, right?

Is there a special roll for HP button, or should I just roll a d6?

D6!

I do believe.

And I've got middling con, so no.


**[04:50]**
I don't have the rebuild document, but I guess I'm a wizard, so I'll take a d6 over a d4.

Yeah.

Previously, I must have rolled pretty well, I think I had like eight HP a little too.

Yeah, you do, which is great.

So you must have rolled like fours of fours, and a five is nice.

I will take that.

Lucky 13 HP.

Oh, are you marking it at the same time I am, or is this just bad?

I am marking.

An MP just goes up by 10?

Yes, it does, to 30.

I'm so smart, I don't get any bonus MP, or do I just learn more spells?


**[05:24]**
You just get a better chance to learn spells, and yeah.

So any first or second level spells that you have not learned, you may attempt to do so

now.

I know there's a lot of spells.

I think I...

Okay.

You only get so many per level, and we only have so much time, so pick a few that you

want.

We'll just...

I think I've already...

I'm good on first level.

There's one that I failed.

I failed Detect Magic, so I think I can reroll on that, right?

Yeah.

That was one that I was trying...

Wait, I have...

Where's the Comprehend Languages?


**[05:56]**
I have Comprehend Languages.

I want Detect Magic.

Yeah, so I'm going to roll for that.

No, I just want my standard spell.

Standard spell check, 65%.

All right, so that is for Detect Magic, 16 is a pass, so I get Detect Magic.

That's a second level spell.

Flames here's good.

I gotta give that one a shot.

Oh, not Levitate?

Oh, this is sick.


**[06:27]**
Levitate is both self or...

Or target.

With a range.

Or target.

Yeah.

I'm going to roll out of order, and I'll roll for that.

Oh, Strength?

Thanks.

That's pretty good.

How many do we want to roll for?

You can learn up to 11.

I don't know if you want to try and learn them all right now.

7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

I don't know if I'll need them, but I don't want to get halfway through the session.

I need at least a few second level spells.

So let's do Levitate, first of all.


**[07:00]**
Out of order.

Okay.

Okay.

I didn't have room for Feather Fall at first level.

The nice thing about...

Oh, I did not get Levitate.

Let's just roll for Flaming Sphere, because that's what I was talking about.

At least in terms of damage, that's one of the most powerful second level spells.

Levitate?

Yeah.

No, Flaming Sphere.

Levitate!

Cool.

If you levitate somebody up...

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Flaming Sphere.

Flaming Sphere.


**[07:30]**
That's a good one.

It's one of the only damaging second level spells.

It's like Flaming Sphere and Maelstassadaro, I think, are the two.

Pyrotechnic sounds good.

I already got a fire spell.

Ride the Wind?

Oh!

That's also a sell for.

It's amazing.

Yeah.

I'm going to roll for Ride the Wind.

I can't...

I know I remember seeing Sean cast that in Lag.

Mm-hmm.


**[08:02]**
We rode the wind.

Oh, wait.

Can I talk?

Is this spoiler chat, or is this just...

No, no.

Yeah, go for it.

If they haven't seen Fro-Fro by now.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Cast Ride the Wind on Izual.

I'm just...

Whatever.

Blew her right off camera.

Right out of campaign.

Ride the Wind.

69.


**[08:32]**
I failed, but that's a good way to go down.

That's what they say.

I don't see any bonuses or anything.

No.

No.

There is a...

The Warlock class, you can deepen your connection

and become more attuned to your DAD, your power,

and that will give you higher chances to learn,

but it also comes with other fun side effects,

some of which are actually fun,

like gaining HP, or horns that can do power,


**[09:03]**
or at-will abilities, or just stat buffs,

and also some drawbacks, like visual changes

that make it clear you're some sort of demon-worshipping thing,

or dragon-worshipping thing.

Strength is more for Warrior classes, right?

It doesn't do much.

Yeah.

For you, it would give you 1-4 points of strength.

10 strength, that's not going to push me into anywhere interesting.

Yeah.

Um...


**[09:35]**
I think I'm surprised they're second level.

Like, Bog Cloud, Detect Evil, that's...

Mm-hmm.

Um...

Knock?

Am I going to need to pick any locks this campaign?

I don't know.

There's a lot of ways to achieve your ends.

Spells are useful.

Scare?

Ooh.

You never know what someone's going to do.

I want them all, Neil.

I want them all.

You never know. I want them all, Neil. I want them all.

Well, you know, you get up to 11. I think there's only 14 spells there, or 13 spells there.


**[10:06]**
I feel like I should just roll on as many as I can. Are you adding these to my character sheet as we roll them? I am.

Okay, so you tell me, should I roll to see how many I roll for, or just do...

You can do as many as you want. Okay.

You can try and roll on all of them, which doesn't sound like a bad idea.

Yeah. Is Contra Simple Object any good?

It's not bad. It's one of my custom spells, if that tells you anything.

No, it's not.


**[10:37]**
Let's see. So you sprinkle some dust. You can form an object that does not weigh more than one pound per level.

It can't be fragile or have moving parts or complicated patterns or construction.

And then it lasts for as long... Can you eat it?

No, it must be... You can't conjure it. It's got to be non-living. You can't conjure a pumpkin.

Correct. Yes.

Because it's made of whatever powder or dust you use to cast the spell.


**[11:09]**
So if you sprinkle, like, aluminum filings, it's an aluminum whatever.

I rolled for Detect Evil on a Lark and got it.

Nice.

Did I roll for Nox, or was I just talking about it?

You just talked about it.

Okay. Then I have Nox of Shore. I don't know if I'll need it, but with this MP system,

you might as well have as many tools in your rows as you can fit.


**[11:40]**
Fog Cloud seems in theme with a dragon, but I don't recall it being a particularly useful spell.

I'm going to roll for Scare. I think that's a good one, even if I'm not sure how I'll use it.

I guess Phoenix is pretty scary. 50. So I do get Scare.

It's a pass. Excellent.

Is Flashful Ward the stupid mask spell?

It's the stupid mask spell.

I invested a lot of gemstones, and I don't think it ever paid off.


**[12:12]**
Stinking Cloud is really good, even if I don't really want it.

Can it be caustic gas, or is that what it is?

They save versus poison, or they are reeling and unable to attack because of nausea for 1d4 plus 1 rounds, which is great.

Stinking Cloud, and I don't think I rolled for Fog Cloud, but I don't know how many.

Let me check my spell list and see how many more slots I got.

One, two, three, four, five.


**[12:45]**
Yeah, so I might as well roll for Fog Cloud.

87 is a pass.

I think I went down the whole list and rolled for Fog Cloud.

Didn't sound lame.

Detect invisibility? Is that lame?

It doesn't seem like it's worth a spell slot.

I'll detect invisibility with my Flaming Spear. Thank you very much.

Yeah, then you're good.


**[13:17]**
Yeah.

I had a thing I was going to say.

Oh, the Watchful Ward.

Does it come with a dragon mask, or do I have to farm for gemstones to get it?

Well, in this context, you would be making these on behalf of Skoria, not Skoria, Shine.

A year later, and you're still getting the two dragons mixed up?

Dude, I get everyone mixed up.

Skoria is dead. Her Radiance, forget the S's.

Her Radiance, thank you.


**[13:47]**
Okay, in that case, I'm going to roll for...

I'll roll for my... I've got the spell slots.

I'll roll for my free dragon mask.

Not free. I earn it through worship and whatever.

Yeah.

Deeds.

Yeah.

Watchful Ward.

I know I was just shit-talking the spell, and I fail.

That's my karma.

Yep. Yep.

And then I believe I get a proficiency, right?

Just a non-weapon or a weapon as well?


**[14:17]**
Not a third. You've got to wait.

Oh, no, yeah, you're right. A non-weapon and a third.

Yes, yes, you do.

Cool.

I forgot what I was planning to spend it on, so maybe it doesn't matter.

Yeah, we'll pick it up next session.

I've got a lot of language slots, too, that I never...

I don't know. I've got a bunch of them.

I'm actually pretty...

Yeah, Mysterian.

Pretty sharp. Mysterian, Orc, Goblin.


**[14:48]**
I think I was, yeah.

Yeah.

I've got the tricks up my sleeve.

Yeah, and comprehend languages, so...

Is there a... Oh, yeah, for sure.

I've got a knack for those things.

An ear for those things.

Is there a dragon language?

What languages does Her Radiance speak?

Her Radiance speaks in Dracissian to you.

What's her accent like?

I know you've probably narrated her on stream before, but I can't recall.


**[15:18]**
She speaks fluently, without much hint of an accent,

but she does have, like, a slow cadence to her speech.

She really takes her time.

And she tries to pick her words carefully.

Got it.

Yeah.

No, OK.


**[15:49]**
I think I'm all leveled up. Am I forgetting anything?

I guess I've got... I'll add the...

You don't get saving throws until higher level.

Yeah.

Yeah, you get saving throws at six.

OK.

Cool.

Yeah, do we want to give any narrative summary of what happens in a year?

No, we will let people imagine what they want to imagine.


**[16:21]**
You can imagine what you want to imagine.

Jump right in on the action?

Absolutely.

You are summoned one fine day.

Oh, go ahead.

No, just thinking about efficiency slot.

I'll be taking until the next rest to spin out, probably.

Yeah.

You are summoned into her radiance's lair one afternoon.

You live within a mountain,

so concepts like day and night are very flexible to you.


**[16:56]**
But she summons you, or you...

One of the other acolytes brings you to her private quarters,

which is...

I imagine...

Have I been in her radiance's chambers before?

You have.

Like, she's got a lot of chambers, and you end up working in all of them.

She prefers to sleep on her piles of coinage.

It's just comfortable.

It's, like, soft.


**[17:26]**
It's like sleeping on a beanbag chair for her.

And so, you know, you got to go in there and get some money from time to time

or take a gem or whatever.

So, yeah, you're definitely familiar with her sleeping quarters,

which technically is wherever she wants,

because you never say no when a dragon wants to sleep somewhere.

There's just no options.

What is it like for you on, like, a character level,


**[17:57]**
being invited into the private chambers for a one-on-one private mission,

private job?

Let's see here.

Under sex, I put no thanks.

We'll put that out there.

I think Phoenix is very dutiful, respectful, deferent, if you will.


**[18:35]**
I would try to take it in stride, even though, yeah, terrifying.

What is she, like, an NH class 8?

What do I know about dragon lore?

Do I feel her dragon fear, or is that, like,

turned off for allies and acolytes?

With a gold dragon like her, we would reclassify it as awe, not fear.


**[19:05]**
Awe. I like that.

That's how we get around that little thing.

So, yes, you feel the awe of the dragon.

It's not something she can control or turn on and off.

Is she in reptilian or human form?

Reptilian form, her true natural form.

I guess dragons aren't reptiles, right?

She's a serpent, a warm-blooded serpent.

They got the scales, but they also got the brain.

They fly, so they've got a high metabolic rate, hollow bones,


**[19:39]**
that sort of thing.

They're probably closer to dinosaurs than they are to anything else,

which kind of defy our standard forms.

She's warm-blooded, or at least magic-blooded, right?

But so are birds, and they're descended from dinosaurs.

But so are birds, and they're descended from dinosaurs.

We know you've come here for the dinosaur lore.

So she invites you in.

Yeah, do I take an E? I bow? Is that customary?


**[20:12]**
I think you decided what the customs are.

Yeah, I think I kneel probably for the duration

of the composition. I've let her speak.

Phoenix, my faithful servant,

I have a task

most important.

There exists still


**[20:42]**
in these lands another

dragon, one who has been

keeping low, who I have

finally proved

to still be here.

I need you to behave as my

emissary, and seek out

the dragon that lives near Lake Mysterium,


**[21:15]**
in the continent, in the kingdom of Aradon,

in the Far East.

I have questions for this beast.

How did they get into this world?

Why are they in hiding?

And will they seek to challenge me

in the bid for rulership of Arcadia?


**[21:51]**
Do you understand those three questions?

How? And why?

And what was the third?

So no one has to use their brains to remember.

Take 200 pieces of gold


**[22:25]**
to smooth your journey.

Return whatever you do not spend,

and spend what you have wisely.

Move back with the answers to these questions.

Yes, you'll make it.

And I back out of the room,

or the chamber.

Perfect.


**[22:55]**
Back a respectful distance, and power walk the rest of the way out of the chamber.

Yep, you hurry on out.

And go procure some gold from...

Well, you actually have to grab it from the pile that she's sleeping on before you leave.

But that's fine.

You know, you just grab it.

I found it myself.

It's not pre-stacked and sacked, is it?

You're the acolyte who would do the stacking of gold to give out to other people, so like...

I'm a smart man.

I probably got it, whatever, rolled and sorted on a table somewhere,


**[23:29]**
or at least on the way out.

Right.

Not that much, but that's good to grab a little money.

Yeah, you grab the four bags of gold.

You head out.

Now, you would know if we look at the map that Lake Mysterium is pretty far from you.

It is...

Well, you would probably go across the sea, across the canal,

down the road that is currently being built,

through Stromheim,


**[23:59]**
and way over here because, as you can see by the map,

this town is destroyed,

and you don't know if there's even a way to get a boat there.

Same thing with Newfort, pretty badly damaged,

may not actually be having access to boats.

And the seas right now, this time of year,

you'd have to go all the way around.

You could maybe take a boat if you wanted to try it,

but you'd need some way of landing in somewhat hostile areas.


**[24:30]**
On the other hand, the road is pretty long.

I ain't afraid of a walk.

I think that's probably the...

Yeah.

I think that's the route.

Yeah, it's literally two and a quarter times as far.

The only tricky part is the canal,

but I think I can probably sort passage from Thaben to High Castle.


**[25:01]**
Not a problem.

And hobo it across the landscape.

Yeah.

To get from Crownhold to Thaben is only 21 miles.

You can do that in a day.

28 miles from Dragon Peak to Crownhold.

You know, two days to Thaben is what you're looking at.

And that's if you walk it.

You have 200 gold at your disposal,

which you can use however you like.

You could get carriages.

You could buy a horse.

No, I think I want to go as low profile as possible.

I am...


**[25:31]**
Yeah, I mean...

What's the word?

I am not unrecognizable.

Or at least I'm quite conspicuous.

Yeah.

Right.

Buy whatever.

Right.

For splendid cultist robes and...

Dragon skin and...

Yeah.


**[26:03]**
Well, is there...

But I use the gold to smooth the passage over.

I think just like tipping well in inns

or crashing in barns.

It's a long way.

So what did we say?

That's like...

It's like 200 something miles.

A couple of weeks.

Yeah.

If you do 24 miles...

By road, if I don't get like waylaid.

Yeah.

I'm seeing...

Yeah.

Yeah, it should be like a week or two.


**[26:33]**
I can do 24 miles a day on foot on good open ground, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

On road, unless the...

As long as the road is clear.

The road is clear.

I don't know.

These are uncertain times.

Certainly.

So I don't have any like history or folklore I think I got,

but I am literate and I spent a year in Shines in Dragon Peak.


**[27:03]**
She had like a library or something?

Absolutely.

Yes.

She has a nice collection of books.

I would be pretty well read by this point.

I can assume that I know she's referring to the Great Worm,

Gold Dragon.

What's his name?

Lake Mysterium?

No.

Or is it the same?

Lake Mysterium is way the heck down over here.

She's talking about the Shadow Dragon.

The Shadow Dragon?


**[27:33]**
Yeah.

So I think I'm just now realizing this after I'm leaving her chamber.

Okay.

All right.

That's a longer walk than I anticipated, but we can do it.

Yeah.

You said that there's no ships running to Shirebrook or...

Shirebrook is a destroyed town.

It hasn't been rebuilt yet.

So there should be no...

Or Newfort.

Same with Newfort.

You wouldn't expect there to be a boat going there,

but maybe if you could get to like...


**[28:03]**
Can you take Pete's Berg down the canal?

You could get a boat to Pete's Berg down the canal.

Or Tassel.

Tassel?

You could get to Tassel or Pete's Berg if you wanted.

Yeah.

100%.

I don't think there's any reason to stop by Stromheim, right?

No.

It is irrelevant to your quest.

Okay.

Okay.


**[28:33]**
We're going to take a boat leg to Tassel?

Because that's got a road.

Or to Pete's Berg because that's closer.

The two routes from whichever port you get off are going to be slightly different.

Do you want more of a travel along a well-defined road or a travel through the wilderness?

I think the...

Oh, I think I'm just trying to make it as quick and efficient as possible.


**[29:05]**
So whatever gets me to the fastest.

I don't necessarily know the landscape that well.

But looking at me like Pete's Berg is further down.

Okay.

Tassel is an easier stopover.

Pete's Berg is further down, but the terrain is unknown,

and there's no like land markers.

You could get lost pretty easily.

Yeah.

Is chartering travel along a road common at this time?

Yes.

If you're in a place of like substance.

Like in High Castle, you could hire a carriage to take you somewhere.

Tassel is a wreck.


**[29:35]**
I think we're looking at going to say Tassel is a wreck.

Yeah, Tassel is just...

Tassel is this whole place a wreck.

Do I know this?

Or am I finding this out on the road?

I'm trying to...

You know, everything south of Stromheim is ruined.

It's just a lot.

The Stromheim is ruined.

It's in total tatters.

Cauldron is sort of being re-established.

Yeah.

What a place.

I think I'm just skipping this and trying


**[30:08]**
to find the shortest distance.

All right.

As far as I can estimate.

To Tassel it is.

We can get a boat from Theban to Dawngate.

And then from Dawngate we can get a boat to Tassel.

Getting to Dawngate is one gold plus five silver and expenses.

And getting from Dawngate to Tassel

is going to be four gold plus five silver and expenses.


**[30:39]**
So that's a total of six gold pieces to get to Tassel.

OK.

So I just added 200, right?

And subtracting six.

Yeah.

195.

Breaking gold coins in this day and age.

Turn eyes.

Not in Theban, not in Dawngate.

Those places are civilized.


**[31:10]**
And how noticed am I on these travels?

Especially in Theban, people recognize your robes

as what they are.

Like in the Crownhold Theban area, when people see you,

they kind of get out of your way and give you

like a polite head bow.

They're familiar with the cults of the dragon.

Dawngate's a little bit further away.

Most people there aren't going to recognize you

for what you are.

Although then like some weird cultist person dude.


**[31:43]**
And by and large, they'll kind of ignore you

until you give them some sign that you are something

to be concerned about.

So we will start a few days later in Tassel.

Now Tassel is, it's been destroyed.

It's sort of been resettled, but not like properly settled.

Like there's bandits here.


**[32:14]**
You think you were here last year and part of your quest

to go after, maybe that was Kneecap.

I can't remember actually.

But Tassel is...

That was near Kneecap, but I never had to cross the canal

for that one, did I?

I can't remember.

It's been a year.

Or down.

Yeah.

But Tassel's not in great shape.

It's essentially a few farmers who live in the area

because the soil is good there.

All the rocks have been pulled out.

There's like a little bit of infrastructure.

There's like canals for irrigation.


**[32:46]**
So there's good reason to want to settle near Tassel

if you're a farmer.

On the other hand, the bandits that live in Tassel

act like petty lords and just run around

and make a mess of things.

But it's still, for some people, it's

better to live free in good large amounts of farmland

and deal with bandits from time to time

than it is to live in a stinky city

or somewhere where you've got someone pushing down

on you more directly.

So when you get to Tassel and you


**[33:17]**
climb the great and recently repaired staircase

all the way back up to the city top,

you find yourself in a camp of the sorts

of people who would probably sell their mothers out

for a nickel, you know?

They look at you a little bit hungry-like.

But you're a single man in weird colt robes

arriving in the ruins of a city after hiking up

300 feet of stairs.


**[33:48]**
That doesn't necessarily bode well for them, you know?

Yeah.

I mean, I think I generally have don't fuck with me vibes.

Mm-hmm.

So.

Yeah.

What's the opposite of a fuck boy?

I don't know.

Whatever it is, that's what you're putting out right now.

Don't fuck with me.

Yeah.

OK.


**[34:22]**
Yeah.

So is this like a town?

Is there a tavern?

Or is it just like.

There is a tavern.

Yeah.

There's a couple of functional buildings.

There's a few tents, but mostly people

live in repurposed houses or, you know, repaired houses.

I mean, this place is a shithole,

but I've spent a lot of my life in shitholes.


**[34:53]**
I think I walk into the situation

as I will have many times before.

One.

And it's time to rest, right?

Ish.

Yeah.

Tired.

Yeah.

I think I'll stop by the tavern for whatever.

Take a load off and get some refreshment

and catch some rumors and hopefully not

have to drop too many, yeah.


**[35:26]**
Yeah.

Many incantations to get myself out of there alive.

You come into the tavern.

And the barkeep here is a middle-aged woman,

42, 43, something like that.

But they've been hard years.

It's visible on her face.

She's got a couple of like spots where her hair comes out

in silver bundles, and you can see, strapped,


**[35:58]**
like visibly high on her ribcage, is a dagger,

and sitting on top of the bar with like a little leash

hanging off of it is a spiked club.

It's just sitting there as a warning of like,

don't mess with me.

She sees you come in.

She walks on over, says very nicely to you,

howdy, stranger.

What can I get for you?

Drink and a chair.


**[36:29]**
And I think I will, do I, I guess

I have to slip her a gold coin at this point, right?

Because that's all that I happen to have.

It's all you got.

Yep.

You can give her the gold.

And yeah, take a seat in the corner with a view of the door

and take a load off and yeah.

She will bring you two drinks and nine silver and change.


**[37:00]**
Two?

OK, whatever, yeah.

She charged you for two and gave you two.

She just, you know, automatically upsold you.

I think I leave the second one just

in the center of the table, at least for now.

And yeah, so I don't necessarily need to rest.

Full HP, full MP.

But it's evening, you know?

It's evening, yeah.

I guess I'm trying to decide whether I feel safe resting

here or if I'm going to chill for a minute


**[37:34]**
and then head out of town.

Yeah, looking around, there's some folks here.

Some young bucks looking for action, a couple of old timers.

Phoenix is neither charismatic nor perceptive.

Excellent.

Not much in the way of social skills

or observational skills.


**[38:04]**
I have brewing, though, so I think I assess the quality

of the drink.

Am I being poisoned?

Can I roll for that?

Yeah, it's a good brewing roll.

I know the hops from this are a little bit old.

You know, they could have been fresher.

But the barley is good.

Poisoned with last year's hops, low-quality Eridonian brew.


**[38:44]**
One of the younger guys in the bar

gets up from his seat, as he stands up,

adjusts his sword belt to sit more comfortably.

He's hanging an arming sword off of his hip

with a dagger next to it.

I'm not a military man, or whatever, a fighting man.

But am I able to assess whether it's an ambush or not?

What's the word for it?


**[39:14]**
A ruse?

Yeah, something like that, yeah.

Don't want to get surprised here by,

or don't want to get jumped here.

Yeah, you could throw a look around.

He's in a group, right?

There was a bunch of people.

One of them that's getting up.

Give me a perception check as you glance and look around

to see if there's folks looming in on you from all sides.

Nah, it looks like it's just the stairs.

Yeah, I look straight at him with my one good eye.

He saddles on over towards you and says, yeah.

saddles on over towards you and says yeah.


**[39:47]**
I don't think I stand up.

Yeah, I'm still, I stay seated and I rotate to like,

look at him, my hood is still sort of shadowed,

catching, yeah.

Hey there, friend.

I don't half cross the face.

And I think, yeah, anyways.

Is he genuine when he says friend?

But I guess I don't have charisma,

but that's a thing you can roll, right?

You have a system for determining a pass.

Yeah, it's not really a friend, you know?

It's like, it's, yeah.


**[40:19]**
Yeah, well.

I usually don't notice these kinds of things.

I think I'm gonna sense the, what would you call it?

The tension and cast a preemptive charm person.

I was really excited for the spell

for thinking about this.

And then we jumped right to level three

and it's not even that impressive,

but I'm happy to have it be the first one of the session.

Yeah, absolutely.

I can't imagine this is the first time

I've Phoenix's cast this,

because this is such an OP spell,

but I don't recall it being recently cast


**[40:50]**
on a Kogu stream.

Yeah, you probably use it in and around crown hold

to get your work done.

Somatic and verbal, but no material.

Do I need to stand to cast a spell, or can I?

You will need to stand up, yeah.

And I'm also gonna ask you to roll initiative,

because he is approaching you, he's not surprised.

I was trying to declare it.

You can't surprise the spell, though.

Yeah, yeah.

Where is my character sheet?


**[41:21]**
I'm not in tassel, am I?

Oh, I'm still over, I moved myself over to tassel.

There's no way you can lose this.

He rolls a 14 on initiative.

Your max possible roll is-

Are you just rolling straight?

I'll do that as well.

Yeah.

Plus one.

There's a cat, oh, one.

So fast.

Yeah, so I think before he even,

like, as he's walking towards me,

he says, hello, friend, and I stand quick,


**[41:52]**
like the snake I am, and look him straight in the eyes

and say, hello, friend,

and he has to roll a saving throw versus a spell, right?

He absolutely does, which is a big old fail.

It's a natural three, always a fail.

And his grin goes from sort of, like, mischievous

to, like, a little bit more warm and welcoming.

Well, welcome to the hearth, buddy.

How you doing?

Are you traveling alone?

Because this ain't a safe place for a man like you all alone.


**[42:23]**
I think I reach out to shake his hand, right?

Is that the custom?

Yeah.

He reaches out and shakes yours.

Yeah, and yeah, just passing through.

Do you mind if I join you?

Please join me for a drink.

And I gesture to the beer I already placed on the table

as if it was waiting for him,

and sits down, and we relax like best friends.


**[42:53]**
Yeah.

Until his, I don't know what his intelligence is,

but at some point he's going to realize

he was charmed by a dragon cultist,

but right now I'm just his best friend, right?

Well, can I read the text of the spell here?

Yeah, his intelligence is 14, so it'll take...

Oh, he'll get another chance.

It'll be a day or two.

It'll be, like, a bad hangover.

Of two months.

Right, he regards the caster as a trusted friend

and ally to be heeded and protected.


**[43:26]**
And this is, like, the leader of the gang, right?

Well, whoever it is, he's just chilling with you, right?

Okay, well, when the leader shows up,

I'll cast Charm Person on him, too.

I mean, I don't have infinite...

I got a lot of empathy.

Yeah, so this will...

This ruse can go on for a while.

Yeah, well, he sits down and...

Until someone passes and says,

you're being bewitched!

He just sits down with you, and he's like,

this is a real dangerous place.

You got to be careful coming through here.


**[43:57]**
You know, just a minute ago, I was thinking,

wow, this guy looks like such an easy mark.

I bet I could take him for everything he's worth.

But you just, you know, you got that vibe around you.

If someone had be better to know than to fight.

What's your business?

I know the area pretty well.

Maybe I can give you a hand.

I am, yeah, just passing through,

taking a brief respite before


**[44:30]**
journeying on to Lake Mysterion.

That'll work.

Are we within earshot of the rest of the bar,

or is it like there's a dim crowd, and we're...

It's kind of quiet.

If you spoke up loudly, they could hear you,

but if you kept your voice low, probably not.

Yeah.

Almost a whisper, but definitely not creepy.

It's totally normal.


**[45:01]**
I'm definitely this guy's friend, right?

Yeah.

And now you're just hanging out

and whispering to one another.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Did he have any information on Lake Mysterion?

He probably doesn't think that's a weird,

creepy place to be traveling to.

I mean, it is a weird, creepy place to be traveling to.

There used to be all sorts of rumors and legends

about that place back in the old days.

That was before my time, but my...


**[45:35]**
Oh, let's call him my mentor.

He used to...

He was from Newfort, and he said near the Crystal Run,

people would go missing,

things sort of just appeared and disappeared.

There were always these whispers

that he said would blow through the trees.

He told me generally to avoid the Crystal Run

and everything in it.

There might be like a hag in there, he said.

Something spooky, at least.


**[46:10]**
Does anyone go up there?

Yeah.

Not that I know of,

but I don't even think anyone lives

near Crystal Run these days or Lake Mysterion.

I think it's all burned out.

Burned?

As in fire?

Yeah, but I meant more metaphorically,

like some of it's been set to fire

and other bits were just pulled down by demons.

Yeah.

Burnout, I get your...


**[46:42]**
I totally understand your...

What's the word?

Innuendos?

Or lingo?

Cool, cool.

Yeah, what does he recommend as the best way to get there?

Like hopping on foot or like...

I can't ride a horse,

so I don't think that's an any more effective way to travel.


**[47:14]**
I guess I'm like, do I cut across Tetherwilds

or do I...

No way, the Tetherwilds are fucking dangerous.

You ride to Shirebrook and then you hike from there?

You've never done that?

Is that a thing?

Yeah, yeah.

I mean, that's how I would do it

because then you could follow the river.

But honestly, getting to Shirebrook

is kind of a pain in the ass.

I would see, if you got some money,

maybe you could like hire a carriage in Cauldron,

you know, really clock some miles or something.

Is that spot between...

Carriage is faster than a...


**[47:46]**
Than a person on foot?

Oh yeah, totally.

What's the...

I think I would typically like hitch a ride

on like a farm cart or whatever,

right, whatever cart traffic is already heading that way.

Is that a thing?

Yeah, you could hop on the back of a turnip cart

or whatever.

There you go, yeah.

That's what I was looking for, a turnip cart.

You could.

It's not much safer than going on foot,

a little bit faster.


**[48:23]**
I don't think I'll have this guy charmed long enough

to travel with.

He'll probably stay here.

Does he remember the effects of the spell

when it wears off?

I don't think he will remember being charmed,

but I think when he sees you next,

the instinct won't be nearly as friendly.

And then at that point, he might be like,

wait, why did I like this guy?

Yeah, so it's not, it's a superficial,


**[48:55]**
you can't, yeah, superficial relationship, he's not good.

Or like when he's uncharmed, he won't think fondly.

Yeah, it's like that person that you're friends with

at the office and like you get along fine,

but if you were ever to have to socialize

out in the real world,

it would just be like kind of awkward.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's the thing, right?

I mean, it's been a long time since I've worked

in an office, but I think that was the thing.


**[49:27]**
Maybe I was just an awkward person.

So did you want to bring him along?

You want to go without him?

I guess I'll leave it to him.

It seems like I've got quite a while.

I guess I'll leave it to him.

It seems like I've got quite a while.

You told me his intelligence, but I forgot it, but it was like 14, 15, 14.

Yeah, it's like two weeks, two weeks.

That's a long ass time.

So if he offers to, uh, for him and his, can he, can he get his gang?

Is he, is he the gang leader?

Does he offer for, uh, for his gang to escort me to, uh, the mountains?


**[50:02]**
He's not made any offers outright, um, but he is in a good position to maybe receive

an offer.

No, he's not like a fighter or anything, is he?

Nah, I mean, he's got an arming sword, so he's not, not a fighter.

Is he armored?

No armor, just the sword.

He doesn't look particularly strong.

He's kind of scrawny, maybe 10 strength, 11 strength.

Yeah, no.

I think my usual go-to would be to, uh, suggest that it be best if he, and you can't make


**[50:46]**
suggestions with this volcano, you can't like make, it's not like a forget, right?

That's not a forget.

He just regards you as a trusted friend.

He's just, he's just a bro.

Or like, suggest that he, yeah.

He's just a bro, you know?

Okay.

I guess, what is the rest of the, uh, population in Tassel?

Sorry, I lost my train of thought.


**[51:23]**
Well, it sounds like, um, you just kick it off with this guy.

He will introduce himself.

His name is, uh, Bones.

He calls himself Bones, but all my friends call me the Butcher.

Um, and he just gives you a friendly warning that, you know, Tassel's a dangerous place,

the roads are dangerous, do, do your best to stay calm or keep a low profile and it'll

be fine.

And, um, and after he finishes his drink, he, yeah, I think I, I could, we suggest that


**[51:57]**
he, you too, that he do the same, you know, one of those, right.

He gets up from the barn and heads back to the group of the people he was with earlier.

All right, then, I think, uh, I think that's that, I think we won't think twice about Bones,

the Butcher, unless I have to, uh, travel this way again.

Well, you know, with Bones coming over, chatting with you and then sitting back down, um, no


**[52:29]**
one else in the tavern's really going to mess with you.

And, um, you can spend the night here for another piece of gold and you can make your

way to Cauldron and I'll just roll some encounter checks along the way.

Encounter checks?

Damn it, is it too late to take, take back?

I bring Bones, the Butcher.

Let's see, um, give me my D100.

I'll charm my way through those encounters too, don't worry.

We'll burn through your MP eventually.


**[53:01]**
Now, you do have your-

I'll charm them with my Flaming Sphere.

You do regain, since you've got a little charm of the dragon with you.

Oh, I do?

Is that, is that same as my Creepy Dragon face mask?

It might be the Creepy Dragon face mask that's actually made out of a dragon scale, yeah.

Oh, I was having the same thought at the same time.

Yeah.

As long as you keep that relic close at hand, you can regain one MP per hour of sleep, maximum

of eight.


**[53:31]**
However, since you are no longer in your patron's house or nor in Congress with your patron,

if you lose your relic, your dragon mask, you will lose one MP per hour of sleep.

Ooh, that's rough.

Yeah, so if you lose it, you might try to like not sleep for many days as you try to

flee on foot, but warlocks trying to not sleep so they don't lose MP do slowly go mad after

many days.

Do I have to, do I have to sleep with the dragon mask to regain the MP, or?


**[54:05]**
You got to keep it close, you know, under your pillow, maybe tucked in your sleeping

jacket or something, close at hand.

You need to, you know, it helps her seep into your thoughts when you're in dream space,

and you dream of gold dragons.

Well, I was only three MP down, so I think I just take a nap and then get an early start

to Cauldron, because I think it's, oh, that's a day, yeah, so I get an early start and try


**[54:43]**
to huff it to Cauldron.

And it's going to be two days, it's 39 miles, as it says.

39?

Yeah, but that's alright.

I'm saying 28, but, oh, and you're, yeah, the road is curvy.

And maybe the scale on this map is off, because it should be 39.

Okay, so hopefully I find something, an inn or a barn along the road.

Yeah, that's not a problem.


**[55:15]**
West Road, is that what that's called?

The West Road, that's correct.

I take the West Road into Cauldron.

Alright.

And encounters?

Encounter checks, let's go.

I'm rolling a 2d10 over here.

The first day to Cauldron and the second day to Cauldron are pretty bland.

You pass a couple of farmers who give you friendly waves, but don't slow down to talk

to you, and you eventually roll into Cauldron, which is a damaged town.


**[55:53]**
Pretty badly damaged, but it is being resettled.

You can see some noble flags flying high on a couple of buildings that have been repurposed.

The keep in the center of town still lies in ruins.

The hot springs, with the bleachers, and the wooden cage that they put people in to put

them over the geyser, as a method of execution.

I think Phoenix looks longingly at the hot springs and wants to, I thought they'd be


**[56:24]**
different kind of hot springs, and then he sees the torture cage above them.

Yeah, with the skeleton in it from like yesterday's murder execution, I mean.

Not the hot springs experience I was hoping for.

It's the Yellowstone experience some people get every year.

Stay on the trails, kids.

Don't go off the trails in Yellowstone.

Yeah, but you can get to Cauldron without any issues.

Now, the journey from Cauldron to Thornwood, though.

Oh, we don't even care about Cauldron?


**[56:56]**
I probably have to spend a gold in Cauldron's whatever.

Picking up some supplies and sleeping, yeah, maybe a gold in Cauldron.

I guess I need food.

Yeah, you can get fresh ration.

I don't think I have ration.

Oh, I have ration.

I have zero ration on my sheet, but I'm sure I would have bought those.

Those are probably single-hand expenses that I got along the way.

Yeah, I've been including rations in your prices for food and drink and everything.

Did we say there was something I had to carry?


**[57:29]**
Oh, the mask.

Yeah, that doesn't weigh anything.

No.

Is there anything that you want to do in Cauldron?

Do you want to hire anyone?

No.

All right.

No.

Cool.

Barkeep for the night.

Whatever.

I fished for rumors, but yeah, with seven charisma, I think it usually doesn't go well,

and I end up having to cover my ass with careful charms.


**[58:01]**
Don't automatically take the fail.

Roll the charisma check.

You could make it.

You see?

Look at that.

I just do.

Now I have to come up with a rumors table.

Oh, buddy, I am so prepared for this shit.

With a 21-year-old, you get two bits of interesting things.

The first is that a family, like a fancy noble family from North Aradon, has moved into Thornwood

and they brought a whole bunch of brick makers and bricklayers with them


**[58:37]**
because they are going to rebuild the castle walls around Thornwood

and return it to a state of civilization after being completely destroyed.

That's the first rumor.

The second rumor that you hear is that the Wraith of the Tetherwilds

that everybody thought was long gone is actually back.

He's returned this year, and he's been taking souls

from the people who stray from Cauldron at night.


**[59:10]**
Cauldron?

That's a local rumor?

That's a local rumor.

Oh, yeah.

I see the ruins of Mystery Rapids in Thornwood.

Yeah.

Have I ever heard those tales?

You've never heard of the Wraith of the Tetherwilds.

It sounds like some local fantasy.

You know, everyone's always talking about bullshit.

That's the difference between being literate and being...

That's the difference between being literate and being I don't know


**[59:43]**
Hip with it

It's a thornwood

It's just a rapid the safe place to stop over do I get that just

If you ask about

Places between here and Thornwood, they'll tell you that there once was a town called Misty Rapids


**[01:00:16]**
But it is completely destroyed and nobody lives there

and it's just rubble and ruins and you should watch out because there's like packs of wild dogs who still roam the area the

You know many generations

Thornwood then they just go through it quickly. Okay, you know, it's out there

Don't stop there the packs of the dogs can be a little dangerous and the ruins provide really good cover for bandits who sometimes lurk

the area


**[01:00:48]**
Hold on to your souls kids

Okay, all righty

We go

Our encounters excellence

We are as we are approaching

Thornwood we're gonna take our first break and we'll come back on the other side with a little more dicing with death

Hello and welcome back to dicing with death as we make our way


**[01:01:22]**
Through Misty Rapids, which we I think we just hurry through it was quickly as possible and we come to the woods round Thornwood

We are met

with an unsettling enemy

You hear them coming from a little bit off

Not so far off that you have a whole bunch of time to make some decisions

And it's not really until you see them that you understand what they are

But coming forth from the trees along the forest path

Are a pair of ogres


**[01:01:55]**
That come tromp tromp tromping

in your direction

They don't look particularly friendly and they don't stop to have conversation

You should initiative for something I don't know what it is you want to do I am I have to declare spells at the beginning of

initiative correct correct

Do I happen to know how many hit die an ogre has


**[01:02:25]**
It's more or less right

I don't know how many hit die an ogre has

I don't know how many hit die an ogre has

I happen to know how many hit die an ogre has

It's more or less right

Should I should I not use that in game or that out of game knowledge?

Um, well, you've been reading you've been educating yourself

You would understand that your spells have limits based on how strong and powerful something is

An ogre is a pretty solid metric to measure things against. Why don't you make me an int check?


**[01:02:56]**
To see if you could understand

I rolled for my spell anyways, but I

I'll hold the I'll mail the int check as well

Yeah, you kill the int check whatever. Yes, you know that they for scare effects six hit die. So they should be affected

and what did they

Ah, right. They are rolling in initiative six

and six

All right, uh phoenix is first

Uh, unless you're gonna yeah only elves half elves and priests are allowed saving throws so


**[01:03:35]**
I

I uh, I scared the ogres. Uh, let's see

Effects creatures through than six hit die. They're both within the whatever the aoe the 15th radius

Frighten creatures on minus two reaction adjust and may drop items held if encumbered

The corner they fight the minus one penalties, I think they I think they get lost

I don't fight your ogres. They run away scared for me. I out over to the ogres

go away and um


**[01:04:09]**
Aoe is only 15 feet. Sorry for that. They are more than 15 feet. Oh wait 15 foot radius. Yeah, uh,

the range is only

60 yards 180 feet. Well, you can definitely do that

Okay, yeah, and but they're 40 feet apart unless you're gonna call ogres fey

They're uh, oh, they're 40 feet apart. They're 40 feet apart. You can only hit one with scare. Oh, that's a bummer. Okay

All this effort to this encounter he beats with a single spell pick your ogre


**[01:04:41]**
Who are you?

the closer one

That guy's behind a bush i'll take him while we get out of the bush, right

I'll scare the one that's not in the uh, it's still really close

This is all really oh he can't quite reach me

Very close. Oh, okay. I'll scare the but i'll scare the ogre in the bush. He just

He is feared

I can't

Duration 1d 4 plus that's enough

That's and we might still be fighting at that point. I guess he's probably rolled out in secret


**[01:05:13]**
It'll be 1d 4 plus three rounds

The frightened creatures have penalty of two may drop in front of them if they if cornered they fight. Yeah, okay

So they they won't fight. I don't know if they run away or back away. Maybe backs away cautiously

Yeah, something like that. He doesn't flee but he's yeah, he's not

The lower ogre at least gets to go

So

And stomp stomp stomp. He will I can't move. Sorry. Can I move after my spell or am I of course?

Yeah, so i'm i'm stumbling backwards to at least get some like I don't let him close and melee with me, right?


**[01:05:49]**
So I I don't think he's quite fast enough like reach me and hit me but i'm like backing away as he's

Whatever cautiously well, unfortunately for you since you can you cast a spell then you can only do a half move

And he can do it maybe at a zigzag so he can't charge

Charges club shout

High and mighty

um, he is an ogre

Can I take cover behind a bush or a tree in action, but you scared someone?


**[01:06:22]**
Oh, yeah

five plus

One for charge is six plus three for thacko

Is nine

It's a miss it's a nine. Oh, yeah, i've got I got yeah

That's your ac. I got dragon armor. I got ac 14

Okay. Yeah

Yeah

Right over your head the next ogre goes and this is the ogre who's trembling and fits and shaking and this ogre

You know scared by the juju magic, uh begins to back off and disappears


**[01:06:58]**
Leaving yeah to

to fight alone

All right, i'm not gonna

The knife fight with an ogre. I think I just got to beat him in initiative. Whoops. I did not roll that right

It is that are we are we doing the same

Mp rules i've seen you using

Other campaigns or I don't know what that I just roll straight so

mp costs so


**[01:07:28]**
I just cast scare. Can I cast her again?

Ah, or do you penalize that?

The previously we didn't I think yeah

Previously didn't it's a great idea though

I just hadn't put it in I hadn't thought of it by the time I was making the warlock class

But I would like to do that if you don't yeah

i'm not a

You're not a sorcerer, right?

So I can just keep spamming my scare spell, right

I do think it'll cost you double mp for the second cast. So instead of six it'll cost you 12


**[01:08:02]**
But that's pretty worth considering. It's yeah, I just nerfed myself. I asked for it, but I think i'll uh

Penalty and oh, but I gotta roll initiatives

Yes, but you can't lose to 14

He can't even beat a five

You drop the scare

Terror

Kills the creature's heart

My heart's beating in real life

On his turn the ogre will stumble and flee


**[01:08:33]**
In the direction that you want to go

but also

Well away from you

I mean, I think yeah, they're pretty slow. So I think I like circle back and around them

Try yeah, are you try to get clear?

Within the uh, whatever I got five minutes before the scare wears off, right? And I think i'm faster than an over

it's like i'm just like

Jog somewhere else and not

not uh

Not get smashed at the club. Thank you very much. Okay. Well two instant win spells totally fine


**[01:09:06]**
Not even worried

Uh, you clear the for that section of the forest and continue on the road ignoring the ogres

Eventually coming to thornwood or the ruins of thornwood. There is a wooden bridge that crosses a moat

Heads into some damaged and destroyed walls where you can see some laborers are laying brick

Uh putting it down picking more up and putting them down too. There are six knights standing

picking more up and putting them down too.

There are six knights standing around the laborers


**[01:09:37]**
with plate mail and long spears, no shields.

And they see you coming and they motion with a free hand

for you to like, get into the city,

it's dangerous out there, hurry up.

Um, yeah, I, I mean, I'm not like, rolling, but I'm whatever,

watching down there, like, whatever, traveling over land,


**[01:10:09]**
so I'm like, whatever.

You casually stroll into town, and they're like, hurry, hurry!

And you're like, okay, that's fine.

Hell, I, uh, I heard there were bandits, right?

But I haven't encountered any?

None yet.

Unless these are they.

Let's say, yeah.

I hear tell there were bandits on the road, but all clear.

And I, it's the only way to town?


**[01:10:40]**
Or is it a ruin?

It's a ruin.

These people, they like repurposed a few structures.

Do they have beer here, Neil?

They do not have a tavern.

This is not a functioning town.

It is an outpost created by someone

on a construction mission.

So it's more like a work camp,

situated in the ruins of a town.


**[01:11:14]**
You're here for at least one night.

Is there anything you'd like to say?

Do you ask, buy, sell, trade, give up, share?

No, I got a bigger request, right?

No, it's not like I pay for a safe room for the night

if it's available.

Otherwise, I guess I just keep on walking.

It is not available.

Am I like the first traveler they've seen?

Is the wall functional, or is it just like a worksite?


**[01:11:45]**
Some of the wall is rebuilt

and some of the wall is completely ruined still.

And they're just, they're going about fixing it.

It'll probably take them a couple of years.

How many people are here?

How large is the group?

60.

You think you can count about 60 folks?

It looks like a worksite.

Yeah.

I don't think I can stay here.

I can't charm 60 people, right?

I think I just keep walking unless it's like nighttime

and I need to.


**[01:12:21]**
Let me just do some math.

No, you've got another 10 miles.

And you, today, you could probably clear the forest

on the other side.

Yeah, it seems interesting.

I am intrigued, but I don't know.

I don't think I have time to stop now.

Okay.

Figure out what's happening here.

All right, well, 10 miles later.

You cross out the other side of the woods.

The people there, they have a couple of questions for you.


**[01:12:52]**
And they're mostly surprised that you're walking the road,

but yeah, you look a little funky.

You're clearly not here for them.

You're just on your way.

And so while they seem curious,

they also don't want to infringe upon your business,

whatever it is.

So if you, they'll ask a couple of things

like where are you going, sir?

And if you give a response, they'll continue to ask,

but I get the impression you're kind of dark and mysterious.


**[01:13:22]**
Yeah, well, I'm trying to pass through

the countryside unnoticed, right?

I'm used to being a peasant,

but here I am as a level three warlock

and it's with whatever.

Mm-hmm.

All right.

Dragon skin and purple robes.

Don't pass very well for a farmer.

Yeah.

As we-

Some kind of permanent illusion or something.


**[01:13:54]**
Some sort of invisibility spell

or some sort of tall mountain that you could ride the wind.

Oh, you don't have to ride the wind.

Social invisibility.

Ah, just have a little sign that says

need change.

I guess there's that one

that can make you appeal like something else, right?

Mm-hmm.

Can it make me look cool?

You could, but then you wouldn't have social invisibility.

Well, what's the,

anyways, we're not gonna get into the hypothetical spelling.


**[01:14:25]**
We've got enough real spells here.

Okay.

Let me roll some more encounter checks

to see what it's like on the way to Shirebrook.

Yeah.

Were there actual plans on this road along the way

or am I just powering through them

and we're rolling on the random table?

You know, I make a lot of plans

and I have a lot of random tables.

And then we just, we do what the game moment calls for.

If you'd like to explore the Thornwood area,


**[01:14:57]**
I have things for Thornwood.

Okay.

We could get sidetracked.

I am very interested,

but I don't know that Phoenix would be.

Ah.

Right, he's on a quest.

Yeah, he's on a quest.

Unless he gets sidetracked by something so heinous

or I don't know.

Well, there's nothing heinous

until you're halfway down the East Road


**[01:15:28]**
a couple of days later.

East Road runs right along Black Pine Marsh,

which sort of makes the Swampwater River unnavigable.

You can't really walk.

You can't really take a boat through the marsh

because there's all sorts of sandbars

and bogs and fallen things.

It's just, it's not very navigable.

And also because of what you see here


**[01:15:58]**
as you begin to make camp one evening,

you're setting your stuff up,

when you feel the faintest sort of trembling in your feet,

this would be one day after the Ogres,

one night after the Ogres.

So a little more MP for you.

Oh, did I just get Ankh-ed?

Neil, you're gonna do me like that?


**[01:16:29]**
You know.

I fail a perception check and get ganked.

If I don't kill a player at least once a year,

the community gets angry.

You've been, oh, you've been waiting so long

to Ankh-ed a party.

I keep trying and people keep ignoring my Ankh-ed quests.

So.

I don't want to do that.

All right, carry on, sir.

Yeah.

Surprise me.

Well, you feel the shaking.


**[01:17:04]**
You can't tell where it's coming from, obviously,

because it's shaking in the ground.

There's no, you'd need like two light beams

set up at right angles

in order to figure out where this is coming from.

And you just don't have that sort of technology here.

But in the fading light of the setting sun,

eventually you hear the sound of something snapping.

And whipping your head to the left,

you see a multi-headed hydra coming out of the swamp


**[01:17:36]**
towards your little camp.

Am I asleep, waking up, resting?

No, you are making camp.

You are like setting up your little cozy spot.

Creepy dusk by the swamp.

Yeah, I need to figure out what distance.

Am I surprised?

What distance?

Yeah, there you go.

Yeah, I got to figure that out.

That's what those signals are for.

Luckily, the DMG has encounter distances

based on terrain types.

Vision and lights.


**[01:18:08]**
Excuse me.

That must be in the encounter section.

Not in the vision and light section.

And it has been, oh Jesus, that's a lot of heads.

Sorry, there's no Jesus.

Oh, Martha.

That's a lot of heads.

Martha, yeah.

You're not surprised because the vibrations in the ground

will alert you to the oncoming hydra.


**[01:18:39]**
So I'm just going to,

well, I guess you could really fail a surprise check

and end up looking the wrong way.

Rule me like a D10 plus two.

Yeah, you know, you're fine, you're fine.

Encounter distance.

No one is surprised.

I've slept since the Ogres, right?

Yeah, I added eight MP to your character already.

Oh, only eight?

So I'm at 19 MP.

Uh-huh, eight per night that you have your mask.


**[01:19:11]**
No, I wasn't.

Okay.

2D12 times 5D10, 5D10 times 10 in feet.

So 230 feet away is when the hydra becomes apparent to you.

And I do believe.

is when the hydra becomes apparent to you and i do believe we should roll initiative

uh actually the hydra does not roll up plus it roll it's a three it rolls up plus nine


**[01:19:42]**
there we go uh i didn't declare yet i'm still thinking but uh i i was can you you can't

prepare spells right so how would you if i've got a spell that has a range that's too short to

have a part like can i you can just lose initiative and let it go yeah is that the

way you have to do it you have to like choose which round to roll in at the right range

yeah i think i don't i think i skip around i think i face the hydra and back away cautiously


**[01:20:15]**
maybe even start running and try to guess its movement speed

around so i don't think i need to roll initiative so but is that a moving quietly moving slowly no

no panic panic running down the road but i don't probably i got it so you know i'm out of there

so i guess i should roll with my uh your movement with deep with a three yeah but we know that it

pulls a 13 so unless i roll really bad okay i see the hydra i turn and run


**[01:20:46]**
um and try to yeah try to gauge its movement speed you bolt from the hydra as the sun begins

to set the hydra comes after you as fast as its large legs will carry it however its movement

speed is only uh three quarters of yours and you are able to easily outpace the huge creature

sorry the gargantuan creature down and away from the swamp and it comes stomp stomp stomp


**[01:21:20]**
after you yeah i hope i didn't lose too much in the uh

the abandoned campsite but um did you want to run down the road and find somewhere safer to

rest this isn't get some distance and then fight the hydra i gotta fight a hydra but i mean i

probably i mean what kind of i'm not you just gave me a free level at the start i'm not gonna

be farming for xp out here okay you never know i could probably i could probably type the hydro

with like a flaming sphere to farm for xp but i don't think we're playing that campaign


**[01:21:55]**
that's actually an interesting idea though we got limited time all right um what did you leave

behind though is a great question it's a great question uh i'm not doing a very job of accounting

for my gears so i think uh unless you're gonna take away the mask in which case i'll go cut your

hydra um let's see i want you to i wouldn't have put anything well like we don't have but you've


**[01:22:27]**
probably got like a bed roll you probably got some food like maybe you had taken your shoes

off already i don't know um i'm gonna have you roll me a d20 high is good for you low is bad for

you to roll a real 20 or uh in low 20 you and i've been playing this game for 28 years now you could

roll a real dive i got this i got i got this cool dragon i die it does it looks like it has a number


**[01:22:59]**
of dots equal to the roll is that it has scales no they're numbers except for the twang is a is a

like a purple dragon oh okay i see the numbers now yeah you got to catch them in the right light

yeah oh cool and it's metal and stupid big and i kid you not i got a point i don't know if that's

really good or really bad but no that's really good i'll uh i'll make you all dizzy with the uh


**[01:23:31]**
no you can't even see in this lighting can't even see

take my word for it i got that i got i got the dragon dragon eye all right guys you pick up

it's good that's good that's the best you could have done uh you have picked up your

bag when you fled you lost nothing um and you escape you escape the dragon not dragon the the

hydra um you can gain eight mp tonight as well in my new campsite that is certified hydra free


**[01:24:07]**
verified is hydra free that is 100 accurate you can verify in the morning when you have not been

eaten and um the next day you will make it into shirebrooke the ruins of shirebrooke once a

sprawling town along the coastline with a keep on top of a hill now it's not but ash and destroyed

stone and well the cobblestones are still there um you can see skeletons but they're not scattered


**[01:24:42]**
around it looks like someone has done a half decent job of like gathering up all the bodies

but they didn't bother burying them they just like moved them somewhere um and so the bodies

just kind of like a pile a laid out row of skeletons outside somewhere um picked apart by

animals wow uh are there living people or it's just no just dead just the dead


**[01:25:13]**
someone came here once and cleaned up a little bit but since then

yeah i think phoenix is a smart guy i think in his even if i even if i can't keep track of it all

phoenix will be taking note of these whatever observations to uh report back to shine like a

deep grief right yeah so we've had a couple right yeah stories and news of a neridonian noble


**[01:25:48]**
paving thornwood with red bricks yeah um and here we have corpses of the dead laid out to

bake in the sun just waiting for a necromancer to wander through it's like a buffet

it's like a buffet for a necromancer

all laid out and prepared pre-desiccated


**[01:26:18]**
actually they're nice and sun bleached they'd make excellent skeletal warriors

oh different campaign oh how we miss you he's still alive we could play him we could switch

no um yeah i think i yeah all right hasten past the dead and

now there's a river between you and it runs like i'm i'm downstream from the river right there's no


**[01:26:57]**
yeah you're at where the river meets the ocean yeah so if you had a boat you could row up the

river but you don't have it's a little less efficient than hiking alongside said river

much less efficient yeah okay i gotta crawl are there are there bridges in shire across

if there once were bridges they have been destroyed and you cannot see sight of them

any longer but you you can swim right you have a swimming proficiency i do indeed have a


**[01:27:30]**
well then i am a hail and hearty at the come yeah of the excuse me of a farm whatever farmer

well well well well um it'll be an easy thing for you to cross the river then

you know that you know where the river meets the ocean is sometimes a pretty dangerous area

but you know you gotta cross where you gotta cross and uh at least where the river meets the

ocean you know there aren't any crocodiles so give me just a quick swimming check


**[01:28:04]**
and uh get across that river there and you'll be home free well you'll you'll be on home

home yeah this is as far as home as possible right yeah

um do you need a few more mp but shirebrook seems like a sketchy spot to rest

mm-hmm

ah okay i'm gonna send a check from you oh no you actually want it i thought this i thought


**[01:28:41]**
that was a binary skill i didn't realize there's actually a a check involved most of the time i

just just barely pass most of the time it's binary but in particularly heavy waves um it can

require a check about a 21 or rough current yeah where the ocean and the sea meet is kind

of an awkward space there and that's the the good spot to cross oh yeah yeah i see yeah

odd tides you know the salt and freshwater meeting and the the different forces in action


**[01:29:12]**
it's chaotic but you you make it across um you're in the woods now you're close

it's maybe a two-day hike to lake mysterium from here you're getting close to your destination

here. You're getting close to your destination. Now you've met one, you've met two dragons

in your life. One was Scoria who burned you badly. The other is-

Oh my god, you mean Scaria. Okay.

It was firebombed by Scoria. Sure, sure.

Oppressed for generations. Yeah, but you're on your way to go speak


**[01:29:46]**
to a third dragon. Now not many men have met one dragon, let alone come in rough

contact with three. How does this, uh, is this, is this what you wanted for your life?

What's going on mentally? I think probably just a whole lot of trauma,

right? That's why, that's why Phoenix is the, uh, the agent for this job.

Like, I don't, I don't know that this registers, whatever, the gravity of, yeah, I think just


**[01:30:27]**
so he's worried, can he, whatever, execute the quest, the request of, uh, Her Radiance?

Like, am I gonna, am I gonna F this up and get shadowblasted into another dimension or

whatever? I don't even know what a shadow dragon can do. I mean, any dragon can wreck

worlds. Yeah, Her Radiance breathes fire and deadly

gas. Um, Scoria breathes just fire. And the shadow dragon, I don't know. You, there's


**[01:31:04]**
no writings of them. No one ever talks about shadow dragons. You didn't even realize it

was the shadow dragon until you left the cave. I think you're going in pretty blind.

All right. Um, so another encounter check for the next

day at the Crystal Run River. Yeah, I think we're still a day or so out.

Um, I think I'm wet from crossing, so I probably, do I have a low-key way to make a fire? I


**[01:31:40]**
probably burn some MP to make a fire and then soup it off, warm up, camp out, keep the spookiness

at bay. I got, yeah, I mean, like, I'm not worried about attracting bandits or something

with the campfire. I want to keep out the, uh.

Keep out the monsters. Whatever, the wolves and whatever.

All right. Well, that next day, it's fairly uneventful. You walk along the river following


**[01:32:20]**
it. It makes you twist and weave and wind, but it's a clear path of where you're supposed

to be headed. You see, um, the signs of lots of animal life, lots of nature, but you don't

see the signs of civilization. You don't see monsters. You don't see any of that stuff

until the evening comes, when you come across a, let me just roll my die here, you come


**[01:32:52]**
across an old woman who has a little hut by the river's edge, and she's standing outside

of her little hut, in her old, worn clothes, with a rabbit that she has skinned and stuck

over a skewer, and is rotating over a fire.

Uh, yeah. So, it's definitely a hag. The question is, how do I handle that? I don't


**[01:33:36]**
have any, uh, superstitions or anything. So, do you.

I would probably run for my life, but, uh, I think, if you would, any sensible piece

you would do, and stop and ask for directions. I think, I mean, she spots me, right? Where


**[01:34:08]**
you, like, see each other. Um, yes. You both spot, you get to kind of the edge of a clearing,

you start to step out, and then it's a few moments later that you realize that miscellaneous

blob was actually, like, a hut with a, and you spot the old woman who spots you, and

she gives you, like, a wave. She's got a full mouth of teeth, regular teeth, um, gives you

a wave. Hello! Uh, good evening. Or, when is it? Afternoon. Afternoon. Afternoon. Uh,


**[01:34:53]**
are there, like, shrunken heads, or dead crows, or is it just a totally ordinary, uh.

Give me a perception check. See what you notice around you, without being too obvious. You

know, giving you a cursory, oh my god. My finest of aptitudes. I think I know what I'm

looking for, right? I heard rumors of a hag, and I'm, no, uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, first


**[01:35:26]**
you didn't notice, but when you remember, oh, there might be a hag around here, and

you start to look around, sure enough, like, up above you, if you, if you tilt your head

up, there is a string with, must be halfling heads, or, or children's heads upon it. Uh,

children's heads. It's probably a myth. You probably can't actually shrink heads, right?

That sounds crazy. There's no way. Um, but yeah, there's, like, a little string of skulls

with a little bit of flesh on them, still hanging between the trees, and there's, like,


**[01:36:01]**
a bit of, um, plant matter had that has been woven into, like, um, like, some sort of frame

as if there ought to be, like, a mirror in the middle. There's, like, a, an oval that's

well formed by, uh, what do you call it? Like, um, woven, like, as if you're weaving a basket,

but you leave a circle in the middle, and then it kind of fans out into more of a spider

web on the outside. I, I kind of zoned out partway through, because you're giving me

the heebie-jeebies, but I, so I, I drop a charm person. Yeah. Do you roll for initiative


**[01:36:37]**
on charm person? Yeah, well, I, I guess I have some clarifying questions before the

spell goes off, but I would like, like, to confirm if, uh, what, if the hag is a bipedal.

She's bipedal. Human, demi-human, humanoid, and man-size or smaller. There's some caveats

here, right? Is she larger than man-size? No. Gotta be demi-human. I mean, she could,

can't, can't they turn giant? Can't they, like, are these? Well, presently, the woman


**[01:37:08]**
is just a regular old woman in front of you, so yes. Yes, uh, she. So they do receive a

saving throw. Okay, that's gonna be tough. I'm probably fleeing at this point when she

passes, but I think, like, before any conversation can even happen, then, yeah. The old woman

waves you over. Come here, darling! Come here! Can I tell if the, if a, how a spell

goes off, or are we just? You cannot tell if she succeeds or fails her saving throw.


**[01:37:42]**
Okay, well. The charming cultist? Uh, steps outside of the woods and waves. I, cautiously,

cautiously approaches, within, like, shouting distance, as if you, like, were walking past

your, an old friend in the woods. Right. Oh, hey! Uh-huh. And, yep, I'm keeping one


**[01:38:16]**
foot, uh, ready to run. Um, she sweetly warns you, oh, darling, I wouldn't go up that way

if I were you! Much safer to come and spend the night here! Um, I do need some MP, but

I, I, I, I'm getting the heebie-jeebies, right? Is there, can I roll a charisma check to determine


**[01:38:48]**
intentions? Yeah, totally! And it's opposed by hers. Totally, yeah. You rolled a 16. She

actually seems pretty straightforward and honest. No, I think I'm in a bit of a, well,

what time is it? It's afternoon. A couple hours before the sun goes down. Yeah, no,

I'm gonna go on my way, but I'll, I will, uh, get, uh, out of character, like, get away on land.

And, no, yeah, I've got a bit of an appointment with, uh, Lake Mysterium.


**[01:39:20]**
Oh, too late.

mysterium a little bit of a hurry but uh yeah that's the place you should avoid

he lurks there and i don't think he'd be too happy to see you

oh who he he of the lake

who is he i'm sorry i can't hear you


**[01:39:51]**
i walk uh i walk close enough that uh that i can stage whisper her uh dramatic uh

who is he the man the beast of many eyes and many arms that lurks beneath the surface

living on the bottom coming up and snatching what he needs


**[01:40:22]**
he's not particularly friendly not even to me

is his name known he goes by many names i'm sure

uh me and my daughters just call him he though oh you have daughters

working around nervously of course are we like we're not in her we're like does she have a


**[01:40:57]**
flickle like something uh no there's no fence there's just like a little meadow

okay oh this isn't her house she's just like out

outside out front of the house cooking over there's a fire yeah got it okay

uh sorry did you give me his name oh she has my name yeah he's got my name so me and my

daughters just call him he's very mysterious okay me and my daughter uh the daughters right

there's none isn't around you don't see any daughters around but maybe that's what those


**[01:41:28]**
heads are

yeah this is scarier than a shadow dragon

the hag not the not whatever tentacle monsters and like the scaring or are they one in the same

hmm dare i ask this uh wood switch for can i risk giving her too much information


**[01:42:02]**
what's the general like vibe about the cult like are we are you supposed to tell people

you're you're in it are you out there recruiting passing out flyers door to door

no we're definitely not we're trying to like turn down to people because when they find out

everyone wants to come and like worship at the dragon's feet because they've got like weird you

know dragon worshiping fetishes and they're not usually worth worth it like you had to go through

like a complex ritual that could have killed you you know it was a it was a thing um so


**[01:42:36]**
the idea is that you're supposed to be serving her radiance and um you let her deal with all

of the like big picture things and you just do the individual tasks so you're not supposed to hide

who you are what you're doing but you're also not supposed to like advertise it unless that

somehow helps you achieve your ends um in which case you know go for it because she's not she has

nothing to hide but you know that subtle use of power is uh yeah 100 casting detect evil how did


**[01:43:10]**
i forget about that one uh so i've hopefully got her charm when she's not trying to charm

not charming me back yeah i can't have uh

anyways uh detect evil the spell discovers emanations of evil from any creature object

or area character alignment does not revealed under most circumstances characters who are

strongly aligned do not stray from the faith and who are at least ninth level might radiate good

or evil if they are intent upon appropriate actions powerful monsters send forth emanations


**[01:43:43]**
of good or evil even if polymorphed aligned on dead radiate evil evilly cursed object or

unholy water radiates evil but traps and vipers and snakes don't um yeah you get pretty strong

evil coming off of this uh kindly old woman in the woods yeah okay well that settles that i uh

i need to rest but it's not gonna be here i think i wish her well and tell her that it'd


**[01:44:13]**
really be best if i got going nonsense it's been so long since i've had a fellow spell caster in

the area uh it would be lovely to sit and chat with you a little what what spells have you

did you just cast i saw them i heard them

oh that's okay um

i


**[01:44:47]**
does she seem to be charmed i can't tell

she seems friendly despite the overwhelming i'm sorry the very strong evil coming from her

um point of clarification like you i chat like what's the definition of good and evil here

in this like am i is is shine oh she's good am i in my uh perspective of the spell absolutely

yeah shine shine is respected about this thing yeah shine is absolutely a good creature there's


**[01:45:20]**
no question about it she would emanate like okay yeah yes would i have a feel for what

relative power levels might be shines or this creep this woman uh the spell yeah both i guess

well this woman is wrong evil so for monsters set forth emanations even a polymorph yeah

you know she's she's got yeah at least nine hit die yeah that's the general guideline


**[01:45:50]**
of that yeah you know the monsters don't usually need nine hit die to radiate evil

but faint moderate strong overwhelming he said strong not ever wrong

his shot would shine be overwhelming overwhelmingly good yeah overwhelmingly awesome yeah

but she asks you what did you just cast i would like to know

i


**[01:46:27]**
really should get going now

i looked in your heart and i saw

blackness there

that's black is my soul that is true this is very true

but not for you

you are just the most interesting little charred creature i've ever seen and that smell coming off


**[01:47:01]**
of you you are just the most interesting little charred creature i've ever seen

and that smell coming off of you she says from like you know 80 feet away that interesting smell

it's the smell of old money it's the smell of dank damp caves

it's a smell of charred flesh what is that smell


**[01:47:38]**
i recognize it

i am an i'm an emissary

here

to

um yeah


**[01:48:09]**
no the shadow dragon that make exterior she stops walking towards kindly

um her face drops it kindly didn't uh give me directions i would be

pleased to be on my way

you know of that creature's existence fewer yet would seek it out

why tell me why good old friend


**[01:48:41]**
if you can

uh guarantee my safe passage the rest of the way there and back i will i will tell you

of course i will give you safe passage if you tell me

me for flicker is my master


**[01:49:14]**
flicker he calls himself

He calls himself she she

Very well then what need I do to get an audience

Well tell me why tell me why you seek her out

We are my daughter's and I her gate guards after all

Oh, I was not necessarily expecting that


**[01:49:49]**
I accidentally walked right in the front door. I mean, I guess

I guess I'm just gonna get out with it. I haven't sensed the dragons typically have

what are they called territory layer what is what is some technical term for it okay


**[01:50:21]**
layer and you sense that right did you I have not received any such what do you call it

No, you've not felt like you've approached it and most people might not notice maybe

some would you who are bound to another beast like this may know may be more sensitive to

those sorts of presences than most people

Okay, getting back to the conversation with Agatha


**[01:50:59]**
I guess I candidly reply I am an emissary of her radiance shine

Seeking three questions three answers of

Bringing three questions to Flickr that's that's the name. Yeah, that's the big bad


**[01:51:34]**
evil guy

Such a troll meal such an innocent name right

All right, I guess I go if she lets me keep talking I will ask yeah questions

Yeah, I guess how did I do my maybe maybe my character always does a serpentine whisper

but for some reason I feel like doing now


**[01:52:04]**
How did they get into this world? Why are they hiding? Will they seek to challenge radium

Maybe that's a little fast but I had to rush through

An emissary of the gold well it's a shame have you considered

creatures here Flickr is a much greater beast than that brutish gold ever could be


**[01:52:46]**
She walks between worlds with ease this plane and that she communes directly with the gods

She holds in her claws the fates of the world five generations from now

She is the true heir to Arcadia

But of course if you wish to speak as a messenger to a messenger

What I shall give you passage to the lair


**[01:53:19]**
I need but three answers and I uh really should be getting on my way

Well then Melody!

She calls out and out from the little hut comes a small hag

Looks like an old woman who's really really small


**[01:53:56]**
A younger hag is that how they like uh they just like grow from boils on

their mother hag's nose is that that's happening here well pop out are old but small

Melody I do believe um was birthed by

I oh god some human woman once upon a time

and given an appropriate name for her lineage


**[01:54:33]**
um Melody comes on out standing you know four and a half feet tall

Does she have like

is this okay all right yeah I feel like I would have detected her evil right

and it's still going even five rounds per level 10 oh it's 10 foot path range 60 yards yeah so

I think you like shift slightly it hasn't been it hasn't been 15 minutes yet has it nope nope


**[01:55:05]**
you can shift and I assume she's also oh yeah moderate evil this one moderate less

less evil but still it's still evil she's even less babies but but it's not zero and that's a

problem yeah yeah yeah exactly all right um and the two hags will lead you in the direction of

the lake um the elder hag warning you that it will be um a day and a night of travel


**[01:55:41]**
but if you need to rest she will of course watch over you while you sleep and you will

have nothing to fear from her who is she the elder hag oh did you want her name uh

yeah actually I don't know how to ask not awkwardly I mean I have

seven charisma and I whisper like a snake I I'm making great impressions here


**[01:56:14]**
I can't remember her name did we ever get her name but which of the wilds I don't think so

she's just like transcended man yeah she's got a title

you give her a name suddenly you got you got a flicker on your hands and

that's actually good I appreciate that

flicker now I gotta figure out how powerful she out of


**[01:56:46]**
I guess in and out like mechanically what I need to figure out is how powerful this

dragon is yeah what's her age class yo

um I mean why am I getting there so they won't answer my questions they're gonna

guide me oh yeah they don't know the answers they're the door guards you gotta go talk to

the dragon I can't like apply them for information like they don't they don't know how

appropriate for them to answer on behalf of their their master or mistress I mean that's


**[01:57:16]**
I thought it was messenger to messenger nope all right going with it I'm yeah yeah Phoenix

is acting like this is all going according to plan yeah it's gonna be a day and a night

of travel um but if that's I don't think I don't think I can sleep with uh if you don't sleep

yeah I don't I don't lose it though right okay I don't think you've got two second level spells

in you or four first level spells in you yeah I don't I mean if I'm using spells against a dragon


**[01:57:53]**
I'm already in trouble right like you don't

I can charm a dragon right you don't charm as an M&M it's not it's not a biped

you can't charm it I think okay what if they were in human form

oh no or is she always like simultaneously a serpent so uh I think her d the true state is

dragon so she cannot be charmed in human form yeah um you walk through the night then


**[01:58:29]**
oh she she's cool with that oh yeah totally if you say you don't want to sleep then you

want to walk then you can walk right through the night um

yeah no I'm not afraid of the dark and if I have a guide to like keep me from tripping in a

whatever a gopher hole or something yeah well she will produce um from her hut or she will send

uh melody back to get from the hut a uh a lantern that has a


**[01:59:05]**
bunch of little like glowy bugs in it um that they use to help light the way through this the forest

to help light the way through the forest.

JOSHUA and JOSHUA Mm-hmm.

And by dawn, you will be arriving at the mouth of a cave

on the east side of the mountains, up in the hills.

There's just a little cave entrance,


**[01:59:36]**
and as the sun begins to rise in the east,

and you're sitting in the shadows of the mountains,

light illuminating the back, the other mountains opposite of you,

you are here.

And the unnamed hag, her daughter, Melody.

Yeah.

Yeah, can I have asked the hag, maybe now I ask them,

or perhaps earlier on the hike, then whatever,

36 hours of walking, probably with breaks and stuff.


**[02:00:06]**
What should I call her?

Has she a title?

Your grace is preferred.

What's the etiquette here?

I probably should have known that,

but I ain't got the etiquette consistency.

It never hurts to ask what the appropriate form of dress is.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Does etiquette include interdimensional diplomacy etiquette?


**[02:00:36]**
I feel like that's pretty uncharted territory.

For most people, probably not, but you are a warlock of a dragon,

so I think you probably pick up on this stuff somehow, right?

Or I'm botching it and picking up on it now.

Yeah, yeah.

I don't have animal handling.

I should have totally rented my own cow.

Or a horse.

I figured I couldn't really ride a horse without it.

You can't do combat from a horse.


**[02:01:07]**
Way back.

Yeah, it's too late.

Standing before you is the cave, the lair entrance,

and as you approach it and the hag stay behind to let you walk forward,

then you can feel the marked territory.

It's almost like you're a dog,

and you can smell that someone's been pissing on this cave wall, right?

There's just like a tingling that runs up the backs of your arms

that lets you know you are in,


**[02:01:38]**
you are approaching the house of another patron.

What is it that I smell?

It's the dragon's lair.

I got that.

I was going for a clarification of the description.

The ambiance.

Like, do I feel it in my bones?

Do I see it in the shadows?

You feel it on the backs of your arms,

and you feel it sort of like at the lower,


**[02:02:12]**
like below your belly, in the abdomen,

like above your crotch but below your belly.

There's this sort of warming motion.

Yeah.

I feel it in my gut.

There's just one of the sisters, right?

The one of the.

Yeah, it's the hag and her one daughter.

Although she didn't say daughter.

The daughter came along.

Uh-huh.

The two of them came along.


**[02:02:42]**
At some point, could I ask how many other daughters she has?

Sure.

She tells you she has a dozen daughters,

but only two of them live here with her.


**[02:03:13]**
Seven charisma?

I don't know how to answer that.

I think that's a lot of daughters.

Yeah, I filed this away in the rumors to take back.

Okay.

And try to walk forward.

Eventually, I think I'm going to experience dragon fear, right?

Most definitely.

Let's just do a quick time check here, Ryan.


**[02:03:43]**
How are you on time?

I know it's getting late.

The sun has long set for me.

Oh, I'm good.

Okay.

Different time zone.

It's only 930 here.

I got it.

Great.

I know you have a busy day.

I'm still going strong.

All right.

No, no, no.

Yeah.

There's no part two.

We aren't meeting the shadow dragon tomorrow.

That's true.

You enter.

I mean, we could, but.


**[02:04:13]**
You enter the lair.

You take maybe a dozen steps in

as the light bounces off the mountains behind you,

giving you a little bit of space

when you begin to feel the fear.

And once again,

there's a slight trembling in the ground beneath you

as the dragon steps, steps, steps through the cave

in your direction.

This creature will make you roll a saving throw


**[02:04:46]**
versus petrification at minus four.

That's right.

Minus four.

Yeah.

Are we inside the cave or are we meeting the shadows

at the entrance?

You have taken a dozen steps in the cave.

Are the hags in front of me?

Behind me?

They are behind you and down the hill.

They're like a...

Okay, they wait outside.

Yeah.


**[02:05:22]**
May I know the consequences of failure on dragon field?

That's something that I would...

Yeah, those fail are stricken with fear.

You're stricken with fear and you fight with a minus two penalty

to attack and damage rolls.

Okay.

That's it.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And then if it's less than one hit die,

that's three automatically or three if they fail?

Yes.

A one or less.

Fewer than one hit die,

as well as all non-carnivorous, non-aggressive creatures


**[02:05:53]**
with fewer hit die than the dragons.

I love how they add that in there.

I love second vision, yeah.

All one hit die, less creatures, and like buffalo and oxen,

and you know.

You know something happened.

They had to include that.

Something came up in play testing,

and then we needed to specify.

I love second vision.

It's in case I showed up with the dragon and dragons there

with a whole herd of cow, cattle.

Right.

They just get a bunch of bulls to charge the dragon cave,


**[02:06:25]**
and someone's like, no, no, no, no, hold on.

We need dragon fear to stop the bull charge.

Enough joking.

Save versus petrification at minus four.

Minus four.

Is there a way to add a modifier to the save?

Just in the brains and in our hearts.

I got brains.

Negative two.

Negative two.

Okay.

I mean, I think it's appropriate that I have.

Isn't a dragon fear save modified by age class?

That's the minus four.


**[02:06:55]**
That's the minus five.

Okay.

Okay.

Yeah.

Doing, doing maths here.

Tempted to pull up a monstrous manual,

but I think I'll probably wait until the session's over.

That's a big, big, big girl.

Yeah.

I'm not sure that might even be bigger than shy.

You do see the dragon's head.

As it snakes forward through the shadows towards where you are.


**[02:07:26]**
I immediately bow.

Definitely trembling.

Doing my best to look dignified while I shit my britches.

The dragon is most certainly smaller than shine.

Interesting.

Not by a lot, but is definitely smaller.

More powerful.

I am not going to cast a detect evil at the dragon, but.


**[02:08:00]**
I will experience the dragon fear and try to make.

Similar guesses of.

The dragon.

Strong, overwhelming.

Yeah.

Whatever it is, it's overwhelming.

It might not be evil though.

I mean, it's working with some hags in theory.

So maybe it's evil.

Well, like you say, you know.

Sometimes you support Saddam Hussein when he invades Iran.

You know.


**[02:08:30]**
Politics.

I guess that's history at this point.

That's history.

Yeah, that was.

Almost three hours.

Not now.

It'll bring it up now.

All right.

All right.

The dragon's head snakes forth.

The dragon's head snakes forth.

And it has like a flickers in and out of its mouth.

And it's.

Dragon flicker.

Or is it like a.


**[02:09:00]**
Is it a.

Dragon or is it like a dragon made a shadow?

No, it's a dragon. Yeah.

A hundred percent.

Black.

Or like gray is shadow.

Oh, I have a picture to share.

She played tricks with them.

I don't think I can, I only catch like,

I flicker, I flick a glance at the,

I've seen this shadow dragon picture.

Easy words.

The dragon.

It's beautiful, it's wearing black.


**[02:09:35]**
The dragon's scales and body are translucent.

So when viewed from your distance,

it more appears to be a massive shadows,

but as its neck careens forward,

the translucence takes on a silvery blue,

not silvery, like a cobalt blue color,

a muted cobalt blue color.

The rest of the cave around you is dark.

And so even though the body is translucent,

it appears mostly black.

And that cobalt blue mixed with the black


**[02:10:07]**
makes it quite dark.

Its forked tongue comes out and tastes the air around you.

Its head lowers off of the ceiling where it was before

and comes to rest maybe three feet above you

and 20 feet away from you.

I think I look down,

trembling, and a deferential, whatever,

like lean, lunge.


**[02:10:41]**
What is a fool like you?

I don't interrupt, that's the latency.

What is a fool like you?

And then the dragon pauses

and it tastes the air once or twice more.

And then it says,

I taste scales upon you.

Show me the scales you brought with you.

Show them now before I eat you.


**[02:11:14]**
I will show her my scale mask.

Should I have worn it into this meeting

or is that not what it's for?

It's a specific useful component for, yeah, yeah.

I mean, you could wear it if you ever wanted to,

but that's not.

When do I get to wear the dragon mask, Neil?

When you go to Masquerade Balls, all right?

Yeah.

You gotta go back to civilization.

I think it's in like a robe pocket or something,


**[02:11:44]**
or maybe it's like a satchel on the inside of the robe.

I don't know.

I reach inside my robe and pull out the scale mask.

The scale mask, I like to try to present it

in a dignified way and like take a knee

while fighting the urge to run for my life or.

The dragon snarls slightly at the mask.

Your grace, I am in a misery of a radiance shine.


**[02:12:20]**
A radiance shine.

I come with three humble questions.

No gold dragon has ever expressed humbleness to anyone.

Ask your impotent questions, minion.

Oh, I'll be quick.

It's only three.

I hear the sound of truth stumbling through them.


**[02:12:53]**
That's how charismatic that I am.

How did you get here to this world?

How did you get here to this world?

I don't know how to think, how to act dragon fear.

I can't.

The dragon seems displeased by this answer.

This question, and yet it answers anyway.

I mean, you're just some third level farmer


**[02:13:24]**
who's been burned asking this creature questions

and it's giving you at least a direct answer.

It's not toying with you or screwing with you.

The dragon simply says, I had help from the god of humans,

the god of chaos, the god of canyons and echoes,

from Malkus himself, he who rules the spring?


**[02:13:57]**
He who rules the spring.

Why?

Why?

I haven't asked that yet, but is he reading my mind?

I don't know, but he continues.

Why?

Because, because it is in his nature

to be drawn to foolishness,


**[02:14:27]**
and it is in my nature to trick those around me.

Why has this deep deity aided me?

Not for his own endeavors, but for mine.

She says with, like, supreme confidence,

as if she truly believes in her heart of hearts,

that she's the one who has pulled the wool

over Malkus's eyes and got him to let her into this area.


**[02:15:00]**
Why are you hiding?

You say, hide. I say, thrive.

The golds, those dirty halfbreeds,

they would never understand the nature of a true dragon.


**[02:15:33]**
They would never understand our origins.

This is not hiding, this is thriving.

Will you seek to challenge Heradium?

I could.

Heradium's...

I could crush her in a single fight.

She would never see it coming.


**[02:16:06]**
All dragons, all fight, all fire, all claw and tooth.

But I would cripple her,

and then pick her to pieces at my leisure.

But no, no.

You should tell her, her shiniest self,

that she has lost her way.


**[02:16:38]**
That she has become more mortal than dragon.

That she has let the hearts and minds of humans

corrupt her from her proper form.

Tell her I'm disappointed.

Tell her I pity her.

Yes, Your Grace.


**[02:17:16]**
Is there any message you would like to convey?

Or any other way I can serve you?

Or whatever.

Yeah.

No, I don't mean it.

Tell her if she wishes to treat with me,


**[02:17:48]**
to have the courage to see me face-to-face.

One superior being to a less superior being.

Oh boy, how often do you get to interview a shadow dragon?

I don't know, but you've asked her three questions,


**[02:18:18]**
and yet you have time.

Is there anything you want to know?

Is there anything?

I don't think there's anything that Phoenix wants to know.

I think he's terrified, and he's ready to get out of here

as soon as his duty is done.

But the viewers, they want, they have questions.

They have so many questions.

You're just leaving these hanging in the air.

Shine, a half-breed?

What is this?

Wait, did she call Shine a half-breed?

She said she's more human than dragon.


**[02:18:48]**
She did call Shine a half-breed directly.

She used that word.

I passed my charisma check.

So this is Ryan being forgetful.

I think Phoenix totally picked up on the insinuation

even if it went over my own head.

So what the implication is that Shine is half-human?

Or I thought it was, I interpreted it as like a...

implication is that shine is half human or i thought it was i interpreted it as like a as a

slight of like could be he's been hanging out with the human she's gone she's gone human that that's

like the most honest and reasonable but i think if that goes to check can you say that i caught


**[02:19:18]**
the devil on tundra will be intended well it could there was an intended meaning but like a

dragon's half breeding like physically like half dragon half what right that seems crazy

um humans don't really mate with dragons that's not like a thing and she's not a half dragon

like shen's definitely a full-fledged dragon so maybe it's just an insult right maybe it's the

i've been living you've been living amongst humans so long that you've lost

you know your way that's a very reasonable interpretation


**[02:19:51]**
i have a minus one reaction to just have you had to roll any i don't think i think

we've bypassed all the uh you keep charming everything you come across or scaring it so

yeah it doesn't the ogres are already hostile you can't you can't make that reaction any worse

yeah there wasn't a check here to see whether he blasts i'm just kind of curious to see what

the shadow dragons breath weapon looks like but i guess i'll have to read the monsters

after this session a cloud of blackness and anyone in it is blinded for one round


**[02:20:26]**
and they lose three quarters of their hit dice or levels that's what it is he would

wreck shine i'm trying to guess what age class he is and i don't think there's any

yeah i think phoenix is terrified and he's need to flee from this lair as as soon as his duty is

done okay and unfortunately i don't have uh eyes on twitch chat to know if they want me to ask

oh no did you did you think that i did oh no no i knew you didn't but i just wanted to


**[02:20:59]**
it needed to be put out there that's what i was trying to say

no no i knew you didn't but i just wanted to it needed to be put out there that there were

questions probably youtube comments but i i'm not uh i'm not i'm not there in the future so

well you can head out the hags will walk you back to shire brook

and you can make your way from there now phoenix this has been quite the adventure there was some


**[02:21:32]**
danger there was a a thief who was going to steal from you and fight you and kill you but you you

defeated the thief pretty easily there were um ogres along the road actually there were some

bandits in misty rapids but you moved on through it very quickly um there were ogres in the thorn

wood forest that you defeated you bypassed stromheim altogether uh there were there were

some gangs in stromheim that were going to try and rob you and there were some goblins in the

thistle forest that were going to try and screw you but you just skipped all that by going straight


**[02:22:03]**
to tassel instead which is great um your way back it would be very similar or you go through

stromheim and uh get ambushed by bandits and goblins um yeah is there anything on phoenix's

mind as he returns home um he's probably to bring back more rumors than i can remember he's probably

gonna like go through he's like debriefing in his head i once he runs down the mountainside


**[02:22:34]**
and gets away from the uh

shadow dragons lair outside of the uh fear aoe

okay yeah going over everything that's happened there were some uh war bombs but i think they all

go over phoenix's head as intriguing as i find all this i currently uh milky for so much


**[02:23:08]**
you can make your way back home chewing on the little bits of knowledge you've gained

the hags did say if you ever wanted to switch patrons you could come and join them

did they imply that i think i think phoenix might have missed that one

yeah it seems like uh phoenix might have missed it seven charisma

yeah um yeah well what what does phoenix think of all of this like you're here to serve this

dragon you've undertaken this dangerous quest you've fought off monsters and brigands and


**[02:23:40]**
facedown hags and their daughters um spoken to a dragon in a cave who believes it has

manipulated a god and you're like a third level farmer all right i'm punching about my weight

this is some heavy some heavy shit i mean yeah i think the gravity is not lost on phoenix so he's

like intent upon delivering what i think is some pretty significant news from around the realm

what right or at least at least some of what i can get i mean i met the shadow dragon that's uh


**[02:24:14]**
that's some confirmed intelligence some of it's just hearsay but

what do you think i'm trying to size them in my head i guess like how like i think this

i think even the phoenix is clear that this uh that flicker is a more powerful

force entity than that irradiance oh i really wanted to get to detect evil can i uh discreetly

have cast the detect evil on the like am i watched by the hags as i leave the lair uh

they're still there waiting for me down the hall down the hill there's no like you do have to go


**[02:24:51]**
down the hill to get to the hag so there's a moment when you leave the cave and you're looking

down the hill is there a moment where i'm like out of sight of the hags and out of sight of the

dragon and i can try to like cast a detect evil to get the vibe of the of the lair on my way out

i don't want to risk i'm not going to risk anything so if i get a moment no i would do

that if not i think we're you can't tell if the dragon is in the cave watching you or if the

dragon is in the cave leaving behind like you don't know if it's looking at you or not from the

cave and possibly like all everywhere all the time like because she seemed to read my mind but maybe


**[02:25:32]**
she was just listening to my whole conversation with the hat or somehow telepathically relayed

from hag to dragon

oh no she asked she tried she talked about why malchus had helped her

well phoenix being a farmer and now an emissary between dragons how do you view your place in

society not just in your your dragon cult but like where does phoenix exist in the greater world


**[02:26:07]**
um i think he is totally buying into the question isn't it

is out to do

like good and it seems like

yeah seems like you're doing good and this is some but this is some like heavy-ass shit so


**[02:26:38]**
taking it seriously feeling its weight on the shoulders as you

dutifully trucks back how do i get uh i mean well i think we are approaching our time here

dutifully trucks back how do i get uh i mean

well i think we are approaching our time here um it's getting late so we can we can gloss over how

we get back or maybe play out the uh journey back next time probably not it'll be a year

we'll have forgotten it'll be a year we'll have forgotten yeah we'll say you make it back safe


**[02:27:10]**
and sound um you can deliver your messages to shine her radiance do you deliver the message that

the shadow dragon thinks she is a weakling yeah i think we established previously that

shine pretty thoroughly debriefs or acolytes may return from

um whatever missions quests but you when you when you got a debrief you're just talking about


**[02:27:44]**
what happened this might be the first time that you have to say rude things to her radiance's

face like yeah have i been present for other debriefings they always one-on-one um there was

i feel like there's a lineup scene earlier i don't know if that was like

smaller things for like training things or um very general purpose tasks you know it's a group

thing where everyone checks in at the same time for personalized private missions like this it's


**[02:28:16]**
usually one-on-one um and then sometimes you know shine will spread that information throughout the

rest of the population if it's important for other people to know i think i operate with

at least i can't forget 100 honesty and transparency like if she asks i'm absolutely

not going to lie um to me ryan like the details of the message are lost like i don't know if

phoenix is probably doesn't necessarily have a better memory than me so i don't know that i'm


**[02:28:48]**
i'm not like a trained messenger i'm not going to look faithfully unless it's like seared into

memory with that give me a check yeah i guess we do that yeah um because like

faithfully deliver the message that's natural 18 modification

Let's see.

Yeah, okay.

Ooh, natural 18, modified 33.

Well, Phoenix is, you know, he's,

I don't know if he's smarter than Ryan,

but he's definitely in a much more dangerous situation

and it's probably,

these things are burning into his brain a little bit more.

Yeah. Yeah.


**[02:29:20]**
So I think you can relay the message faithfully.

Yeah. So, yeah, I can, I'm, yeah,

I'll be honest, but I don't hold back my interpretation,

I guess, like my assessment.

I don't know how to word it, but like in character,

but like indicating the power level of the, of Flickr.

Yeah.

That's because I start by relaying the question.

I don't know if she has follow-up questions.


**[02:29:51]**
Her only follow-up.

Do you want to play out that conversation or we summarize?

I'm kind of running out of time here.

She, her only follow-up question

is whether or not you noticed any hatchlings

near the shadow dragon.

If there was any mention.

What was that again?

If there was any mention of children or anything like that.


**[02:30:22]**
I don't know if I've debriefed on that.

Do we go beginning to end?

Like does she already know about the hags?

Yeah. Yeah.

You've already given us a little debrief.

This is just the question at the end.

Yeah. The hag is calling what she is.

Mentioned 12 daughters of which I only saw one.

12 daughters of which I only saw one.

I assumed those are more hags scattered throughout the land.


**[02:30:56]**
But not shadow dragon hatchlings.

None that I saw, observed that I wasn't looking for them.

She would not have revealed them if you had asked,

but her pride would not let her lie to me.

My brethren are proud beasts.


**[02:31:29]**
They do not value or care much for the opinions

of more mortal creatures like humans,

but worm to worm, to lie would be to admit weakness,

to admit that you fear or are cowed by another.

Yet she would not acknowledge her children

or openly display them typically.


**[02:32:04]**
I have no reason to believe that she has them,

but if she does, it could be a problem one day.

Is it known if Shine can scry?

Shine is known...

Well, Shine has a pet wizard.

This guy who keeps calling himself King Imrik,

and he's got a bunch of spells.

So like Shine can scry, you know?


**[02:32:37]**
All right.

Well, I learned it herself when the wizard

had more important things to do.

Yeah, well, she does have some spells.

She has charm person, identify, locate object,

special force suggestion.

No, she doesn't have any scrying spells.

Except for...

Does she have the spells that her acolytes receive

or do we have separate spell lists?

Do I know that she...

Can she cast every spell that I know?

Is that something that I would know?

She cannot cast most spells that you know.


**[02:33:10]**
That's interesting, okay.

Yeah.

I think...

Like, I guess I have the message

a little bit from the Shadow Dragon,

but that didn't actually seem to be like the biggest threat.

Okay, I was sent there to answer questions.

Shine's questions or get answers to Shine's questions.

No, yeah.

Shadow Dragon is sculpted by Malkus.


**[02:33:41]**
I will have relayed the conversation,

like the rambling.

Right, right.

References to proper ways of being a dragon.

I don't know how I present it.

I try to like summarize the situation,

but it kind of went over my head.

Yeah.

Well, you're a decent messenger.

You can relay it all.

I'm just being a dragon.

Shine doesn't know what she's...

Anyways.

Yeah, because it doesn't seem like,

it doesn't seem like a real challenge right now.

She's just content to hang out here in Shadow Valley.


**[02:34:13]**
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Create a little shadow lair.

And she said that with pride,

like that was the goal somehow,

which is so different from how Scoria and Shine,

even like Nixxiom and the others

have behaved in ages past.

You know, just a really ornery dragon

hanging out in that cave.

Like your hillbilly grandpa who took to the mountains

and is like, I ain't ever coming down out them hills.

What are you city folk doing?

You think you're so smart?

Fucking.


**[02:34:44]**
Yeah.

Maybe I'm more concerned about the realm falling to shit.

The ruins and the ghost stories and the...

Well, that's all Scoria's doing, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

I guess, I think Phoenix probably goes in excited

expecting to debrief on every details

of every tavern rumor he had about something going to hell

and Shine probably like freezes right out of it.

That's like her everyday reports she did.

Uh-huh.

Yeah.


**[02:35:15]**
How often does a shadow dragon slip between planes

with the help of a god of chaos?

Yeah.

But it sounds like it's not actually,

it's just chill.

It's just fine.

Everyone's just vibing.

It's just fine.

Just two mutually cool dragons doing their own things.

Definitely not about to throw down.

But I think on that note,

that is going to be the end of this year's

Dicing with Death.

We'll be back.

Don't put it that way.


**[02:35:46]**
It's only July, but probably realistically, yeah.

Realistically, yeah.

Yeah.

You never know.

Maybe we'll be back in 2026.

Maybe we'll be back in 2025.

Who knows?

Thank you so much, Ryan,

for making some time to come and play.

Yeah.

I hope this was a worthy.

Sorry if I'm a little rusty.

Oh, could never be.

Yeah.

I mean, only you are going to start casting Charm Person

on someone mid-sentence when they're walking up to you


**[02:36:16]**
in a bar when you're,

you know, you're in a bar.

Every other player would be so afraid

that, like, it might go wrong

and something bad might happen.

And you're like, no, no, no, cut it off mid-sentence.

It's my past.

I would be running for my life, but, you know, I got there.

I'm just saying, you got balls, Ryan.

I got the vibes.

And as they say in Team America World Police,

I like balls.

I'm going to throw my dragon ball,

but I think it's me in the room.

I'm going to throw my dragon ball.

I'm going to throw my dragon ball.


**[02:36:47]**
I'm going to throw my dragon ball,

but I think it's me in the room.

Oh, I think it's right there.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

All right.

Cool, this is fun.

Thanks for watching.

Thanks for playing.

Catch you next time.
