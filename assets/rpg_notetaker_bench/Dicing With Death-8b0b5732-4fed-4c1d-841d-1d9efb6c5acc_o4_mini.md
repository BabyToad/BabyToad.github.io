### Scene 2: Audience with Shine, the Great Gold Dragon  
• Phoenix summoned to Shine’s private chamber in Dragon Peak  
  – Dragon asleep on coin pile; acolytes pre-stack gold  
• Shine’s mission briefing:  
  1. How did the Shadow Dragon arrive in this world?  
  2. Why is it hiding near Lake Mysterium?  
  3. Will it challenge Shine for rulership of Arcadia?  
• Phoenix receives 200 gp “reward fund”  
• Immediate departure: plan route via Tassel → Thornwood → Lake Mysterium  

### Scene 3: Arrival & Encounter in Tassel  
• Travel by barge: Theban → Dawngate (1 gp 5 sp) → Tassel (4 gp 5 sp remaining)  
• Tassel described: ruined farming outpost, bandit-run  
• Phoenix enters tavern, pays 1 gp; rolls Brewing check to assess ale quality  
  – Identifies stale hops, decent barley  
• Bones the Butcher (NPC) – arming sword, dagger; approaches Phoenix  
  – Initiative: Bones 14  
  – Phoenix casts Charm Person (DC ?), Bones rolls nat 3 → fails save  
  – Bones regards Phoenix as ally; offers local advice, then returns to his group  
• Phoenix rests (recovers MP) and departs next morning  

### Scene 4: Through Cauldron & Thornwood  
• West Road travel (39 mi in two days) to Cauldron ruins  
  – Cauldron: hot-spring executions, a few nobles, rebuilding efforts  
  – Spends 1 gp on food & lodging; rumors gathered:  
    • North Aradon nobles are hiring masons to rebuild Thornwood  
    • “Wraith of the Tetherwilds” preys on travelers after dark  
• Morning departure into Thornwood work camps  
  – Six knights guard bricklayers repairing city walls  
  – Phoenix declines to linger, continues eastward  

### Scene 5: Thornwood Woods – Ogre Ambush  
• Into the woods beyond Thornwood, two ogres emerge (HD 6 each)  
  – Phoenix casts Scare (15 ft radius, max HD 6):  
    • Ogre #1 within 15 ft fails save (nat 1) → frightened 1d4+3 rounds  
    • Ogre #2 outside radius unaffected  
  – Ogre #2 charges: Attack 6+3 = 9 vs. AC 14 → miss  
  – Ogres flee in fear; Phoenix circles clear and moves on unscathed  

### Scene 6: Hydra Pursuit & Shirebrook Ruins  
• Camp by Black Pine Marsh, sense ground tremors at dusk  
• Hydra (Gargantuan multi-headed, HD 12) bursts from swamp  
  – Phoenix rolls initiative, then Decision: run (movement 4 vs. hydra 3)  
  – Phoenix outpaces and escapes without damage  
• Dawn: swim across river mouth to Shirebrook ruins (Swim check 21)  
  – Shirebrook: cobblestones intact, bleached skeletons neatly arranged → possible necromancer ploy  
  – No living inhabitants; Phoenix presses on following river upstream  

### Scene 7: Hag’s Hut & Ascent to Dragon Lair  
• Late afternoon: small hut on riverbank, elder hag roasting rabbit  
  – Phoenix rolls Detect Evil → overwhelming evil emanation  
  – Perception reveals string of desiccated heads, woven plant “mirror frame”  
  – Hag greets Phoenix; Phoenix’s Cha check 16 → gauges sincerity  
• Hag summons daughter Melody (4 ft 6 in) for investigation  
• Phoenix states mission: seeks Shadow Dragon near Lake Mysterium  
• Hag warns of “beast of many eyes and arms” beneath the lake  
  – Offers safe passage if Phoenix seeks only the answers given to him  
• Hag provides glow-in-jar “lantern” escort through woods overnight  
• Dawn: arrive at cave mouth on east side of mountains; hags depart  

### Scene 8: Shadow Dragon Audience  
• Phoenix enters cave ~12 steps in; senses dragon’s territory & fear effect  
  – Save vs. Fear DC –4 (dragon age modifier) → Phoenix is stricken but stands firm (–2 penalty to Attacks)  
• Shadow Dragon emerges:  
  – Translucent charcoal black scales with muted cobalt-blue shimmer  
  – Head rests 3 ft above Phoenix, 20 ft away  
• Dragon’s questions & answers:  
  1. Origin?  
     “Malkus, god of chaos & springs, granted me passage between worlds.”  
  2. Reason for hiding?  
     “I thrive in subtlety; gold-bred half-breeds care only for show.”  
  3. Challenge Shine?  
     “I could crush him swiftly, but I pity that gold dragon who’s forgotten his nature. Let him send a true envoy next time.”  
• Phoenix inquires on dragon offspring – dragon scoffs, no mention of hatchlings (hag’s dozen “daughters” appear unrelated)  
• Mission complete, Phoenix departs  

NPC Ledger  
• Shine – Great Gold Dragon patron, resides in Dragon Peak  
• Bones the Butcher – local “boss” in Tassel tavern, charmed by Phoenix  
• Tassel Innkeeper – hardened barmaid, provided ale and lodging  
• Thornwood Knights (×6) – plate and spear, guard castle-work site  
• Ogres (×2) – HD 6 each, frightened off by Scare spell  
• Hydra – Gargantuan multi-headed beast, HD 12, pursued Phoenix but failed to catch  
• Elder Hag – riverbank witch, strong Evil aura, guides across Tetherwilds  
• Melody – hag’s small daughter (~4 ft 6 in), accompanies Phoenix overnight  
• Shadow Dragon (alias “Flicker”?) – planar dragon allied to Malkus, hiding near Lake Mysterium  

Notes for Next Session  
• Phoenix returns to Shine for debrief—reactions to “half-breed” slight and draconic pride wounds  
• Explore broader implications of Malkus’s sponsorship of Shadow Dragon  
• Investigate Wraith of the Tetherwilds threat on return – possible new quest hook  
• Track developments in Thornwood rebuilding and regional stability  
• Assign Phoenix’s new proficiency and equip next adventure (magic item shopping?)
