# Travel

> *The land stretches beyond reason. Ice and stone and silence that swallows mechs whole. You are small here. Your machine is small. Only the cold is infinite.*

## The Hard Truth of Distance

Mechs are gods of war, not gods of travel. They consume fuel like fire consumes air, break down in conditions that wouldn't slow a person on foot, and need supply chains that stretch across a continent of ice.

Between settlements lie days or weeks of frozen waste. No mech travels alone and survives. No pilot crosses the deep ice without paying the land its due.

## Before You Travel

### Supply Requirements
Every leg of the journey demands payment:
- **1 Fuel** for base consumption
- **Supplies** for crew and yourself
- **Spare parts** for inevitable breakdowns

### Travel Preparations
Choose your support:

**Solo Travel** (Desperate or Foolish)
- +1 Fuel consumption
- Automatically face all travel complications alone
- No backup when things go wrong
> *"Pride goeth before the fall, and the ice remembers fools."*

**Convoy Travel** (Standard for any smart pilot)
- Supply trucks, crew, guides
- Shared resources and expertise
- Social complications and obligations
- Roll for Convoy Dynamics each journey

**Authority Escort** (Safest but Costly)
- Official supply lines and support
- Navigation handled by authority bureaucrats
- Political complications and oversight
- May be conscripted for Authority business

## The Travel Roll

### Known Routes
Roll once for the entire journey between settlements.

**Choose Your Navigation:**

**Hire Local Guide**
- Cost: Negotiable (favors, fuel, violence)
- Roll 2d6 (guides minimize risk and variance)
- Guides always count as having rolled at least a partial success

**Follow Authority Roads**
- Cost: Papers, permits, tariffs
- Automatic navigation success
- Roll for Authority Complications instead

**Navigate Yourself**
- Roll 2d6+Navigation or +Survival
- Higher variance, more complications
- Complete independence

### Unknown Territory
When venturing into unmapped regions, break travel into legs. Each day or major terrain feature requires its own roll and complications.

## Travel Results

### Navigation Success (10+)
- Arrive on schedule without major incident
- Learn something valuable about the route
- Choose: reduce fuel consumption by 1 OR gain useful intel

### Partial Success (7-9)
You reach your destination but choose one:
- **Delayed**: Arrive late, consuming extra fuel
- **Costly**: Face a complication that demands resources or favors
- **Exposed**: Something follows you or learns of your business

### Travel Crisis (6-)
The land claims its due. Choose two:
- Lost: Add days to your journey, consuming extra fuel
- Breakdown: Mech suffers damage requiring repairs
- Encounter: Face a threat that may require a sortie
- Separated: If traveling with others, someone goes missing
- Storm-Bound: Weather forces dangerous shelter choices

## Seasonal Travel

### Frost (The Long Dark)
>*Most of the year. The ice roads are open but unforgiving.*

**Advantages:**
- Frozen rivers become highways
- Clear sight lines across the ice fields
- Avalanche zones are predictable

**Hazards:**
- Limited daylight for navigation
- Equipment failures in extreme cold
- Settlements may be sealed against winter

**Travel Modifier:** +0 to navigation, +1 fuel consumption

### Thaw (The Breaking)
>*Dangerous transition between seasons. The ice remembers nothing.*

**Advantages:**
- Some blocked routes open up
- Desperate people offer better deals

**Hazards:**
- Routes change daily as ice breaks
- Flash floods and mudslides
- Equipment failures from temperature swings

**Travel Modifier:** -2 to navigation, routes may become impassable mid-journey

### Bloom (The Brief Summer)
>*Short growing season. Everyone moves while they can.*

**Advantages:**
- Best traveling weather
- All routes accessible
- Maximum trade opportunities

**Hazards:**
- Crowded routes and competition
- Higher prices for everything
- Time pressure before next Frost

**Travel Modifier:** +1 to navigation, normal fuel consumption

## Convoy Dynamics

When traveling with others, roll for relationship complications:

| 2d6 | Convoy Complication |
|-----|---------------------|
| 2-3 | **Mutiny**: Crew questions your leadership or route |
| 4-5 | **Breakdown**: Critical supply vehicle needs repairs |
| 6-8 | **Politics**: Someone has conflicting goals or loyalties |
| 9-10| **Discovery**: Find something valuable but contested |
| 11-12| **Revelation**: Learn important information about your destination |
{: .mechanics-table}

### Authority Route Complications

When using official roads, roll for bureaucratic entanglements:

| 2d6 | Authority Complication |
|-----|------------------------|
| 2-3 | **Conscription**: Required to handle local Authority business |
| 4-5 | **Inspection**: Cargo searched, papers questioned, delays |
| 6-8 | **Tolls**: Unexpected fees, taxes, or "donations" required |
| 9-10| **Intelligence**: Authorities want information about your business |
| 11-12| **Escort**: Assigned unwanted official escort or observer |
{: .mechanics-table}

## Local Guide Relationships

Guides reduce travel risk but come with their own complications:

### Guide Motivations
- **Homeward**: Needs to reach family or clan territory
- **Trade**: Building relationships for future business
- **Political**: Advancing local faction interests
- **Spiritual**: Following traditional or sacred routes
- **Fugitive**: Avoiding someone or something
- **Curious**: Wants to know what you're really doing

### Working with Guides
- Guides know seasonal variations and hidden paths
- Can negotiate with locals you'd never reach
- May take routes that serve their purposes, not yours
- Always know more than they're telling you
- Judge you by standards you don't understand

> *"The land speaks to those who listen. Outsiders hear only wind."*

## Travel Hazards

### Environmental
- **Ice Storms**: Visibility drops to zero, equipment icing
- **Avalanche Zones**: Unstable terrain, sound discipline required
- **Crevasse Fields**: Hidden chasms that can swallow mechs
- **Temperature Extremes**: Systems failure, hypothermia risk

### Human
- **Bandits**: Desperate people with improvised weapons
- **Territorial Disputes**: Caught between competing claims
- **Refugees**: Fleeing disaster, may be pursued by threats
- **Authority Patrols**: Questions, searches, potential conscription

### Mechanical
- **Fuel Line Freeze**: Common in extreme cold
- **Gyro Drift**: Navigation systems fail in magnetic anomalies
- **Joint Seizure**: Hydraulics lock up, requires field repair
- **Sensor Ghost**: Equipment malfunctions create false readings

## When Travel Becomes a Sortie

Sometimes the journey becomes the mission:
- Convoy under sustained attack
- Major mechanical failure in hostile territory
- Discovered something that changes everything
- Weather forces shelter in a dangerous location
- Authority forces attempt to detain or conscript you

> *"The ice cares nothing for your schedule. The land takes what it is owed."*
