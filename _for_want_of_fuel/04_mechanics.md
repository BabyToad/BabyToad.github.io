## Sortie
### After a Sortie

##### What You Bring Back
Every mission, sortie or expedition earns you something.

| Fuel | Title                         | Description                                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Blood for Nothing             | The mission failed. You lost ground, gear or people.           |
| 2    | The Land is Not Yet Satisfied | Minor success. A cost was paid. Maybe too much.                |
| 4    | The Fire Burns                | Moderate success. Some control gained, some resources secured. |
| 6    | Something Dead Gave Way       | Strong success. You left a mark. Something ancient stirred.    |
| 8    | The Earth Remembers           | Major success. The land and people echo your name.             |

>"The fire dies when the blood runs dry. The land takes what it is owed."

You must pay tribute to the land to maintain your mech and yourselves. Pay 1 Cred per Tier.
This is not about money or glory. This is about staying alive long enough to kill again.

## Downtime

You get two downtime actions.

#### **Stoke the Furnace**
Spend fuel to refuel your frame or body.
- Spend one fuel
- Recover all your HP or recover all your mechs HP.
> _The warmest fire comes from things that once moved._

#### **Work the Bone**
Repair your mech, mend your gear, or rebuild your limbs.
- Roll +Tech or +Heal: 10 = full restore, 7-9 = patch job, 6+ = costly mishap
- On a 12+, you may also add a _makeshift mod_ (unstable, one-use)
> _Steel is only honest when it breaks._

#### **Cut a Deal**
Leverage favors, guilt, barter, or flesh to get what you need.
- Choose: gain black-market salvage, medica supplies, intel, safe passage or anything
- GM sets cost: reputation, fuel, blood
- If you fail to pay later, all who helped you will know
> _Nothing is ever given. Everything taken must be paid._

#### **Burn the Map**
Scout unknown terrain or send rumors into the wastes.
- Learn about a new point on the map
- Ask 1 question about faction movements, convoy paths, hidden threats
- Mark 1 Stress—news is costly.
> _The land speaks in wind and ash and silence. Listen or die._

#### **Wager the Self**
Choose one ritual below. Roll 2d6 (optionally modified by a stat like Resolve or Guts).
- On a 10: Clear 6 stress.
- On a 7-9 Clear 4 stress.
- On a 2-6: Clear 2 stress and suffer a **mark** (complication, trauma, or omen).

**Brand the Beast** – Scar your mount, mech, or bonded creature. Whisper your name into the wound.  
**Speak the Names** – Recite the names of the dead. Carve them into your mech or flesh.  
**Lay Down the Mask** – Confess to someone or something that cannot or will not answer.  
**Burn the Mercy** – Destroy something you spared: a prisoner, a memory, a relic.  
**Read the Ice** – Pilgrimage to a frozen place. Ask the land a question. Accept the answer.  
**Feast in Silence** – Eat something you shouldn't. Do not speak.  
**Work the Bone** – Carve a token from bone or ruin. Name it after someone you failed. Leave it.  
**Stand the Night** – Go out into the frost naked, unarmed. Return if you can.  
> _You must pay something to feel nothing._

#### **Bury the Dead**
Mourn the lost, name them, or feed them to the cold.
- Clear 2 stress
- Gain a temporary Blessing or Curse, GM's choice
- If you fail to bury the dead, they may return
> _There are no ghosts here. Only witnesses._

#### **Forget What You Were**
Alter your path. Change your code. Take on a new scar.
- Choose a new Role-specific XP trigger
- Gain a Scar. Physical or Mental.
- Clear your Stress
> _This world has no place for who you used to be._

## The Reward Of Blood
Award **1 XP per line fulfilled** at the end of each session. Players should justify briefly. GM has final call.

**Mercy Breaks You**
	If you showed mercy and things became worse because of it, gain XP.
**Blood Honors You**
	If you killed a named foe or many innocents, gain XP.
**Hunger Commands You**
	If you diminished yourself for fuel, warmth, or survival, gain XP.
 **God Rides the Horizon**
	If you witnessed, provoked, or embodied something sublime and brutal, gain XP.

### Scars of the Long Night
Every Sortie comes with a **scar**. Either roll or choose one. These shape worldbuilding, add flavor, and weight to your violence.

|d6|Scar|
|---|---|
|1|The land changed. Ice melted or a crater filled. A map must be updated.|
|2|A mech component gained a quirk. It weeps coolant or hums psalms.|
|3|The battlefield ground is permanently stained with oil and blood. Animals avoid it.|
|4|A canyon echoes with the screams of the fallen.|
|5|The squad's mechs now leave scorched footprints in the ice.|
|6|Blood has frozen on your mech. It wont come off.|
