## Narrative Themes

### **The Reward of Blood**
Violence brings safety, heat, respect and even divinity. <br>
The further you go from civilisation the more violence becomes a currency.
### **Mercy is Sin**
Attempts at redemption lead only to death or corruption.<br>
What you spare today will return tomorrow, twisted into something worse.
### **The Land is God**
Everything pales in comparison to the land itself. Your mech is large, the mountains are titanic. You cannot outdo the land, ever.<br>
The further you journey, the more time and space become unmoored from reality.<br>
Oases are always contested, never safe havens.
### **Scars of the Long Night**
The land bears eternal scars from the last war, with apocalyptic fires of the Scream frozen and preserved in ice.<br>
Your deeds carve scriptures into the dirt, testimonies that outlast flesh.
## Aesthetics

> The sky bled and bled and the night did not come.

> They fought and died and none sang for them.

#### ON TRAVEL
> For three days they rode the glacier fields in silence, the snow crust splitting beneath their weight. The sun never rose proper. It circled low and sour in the east like a judgement half-sworn. They came upon bones swept clean by the wind. No beast or carrion bird in sight. Only the cold.

#### ON FACTIONS
>The men of the Sultanate bore iron-standard spears and spoke in parables even as they killed. They lit fires from the fat of the dead and prayed with rifles slung across their shoulders. The Republic soldiers wore mirrored goggles and did not speak at all. They bled oil when cut.

#### ON LANDSCAPE
>They crossed the scar of the crater where once land had ruptured upward and frozen in the act, as if in violence it had sought some last articulation of grace. The wind blew ice through the ravine like filings through magnet and the sky above was the white of old scars.
