Endstation is set on a distant, mysterious planet, home to outcasts and explorers. From the solitary stronghold of civilization, known as the Inside, guilds of treasure hunters and salvagers embark into the wild, uncanny Outside. Guide a guild of explorers stranded at the end of the known universe as they seek forgotten secrets in ancient ruins and make connections with Endstation’s residents.

Endstation features:
- **Hangout Game**: Build relationships with a quirky cast, uncovering secrets and ambitions.
- **Cozy Strangeness**: Navigate a world where remnants of past civilizations meet thriving life.
- **Jovial Distress**: Balance exploration and decision-making against the relentless march of time.

Encounter characters like Tseya, the enigmatic mystic, and Uriah, the pragmatic Guild Creditor, as you restore outposts, explore hidden temples, and craft a guild that endures. Each choice shapes the journey, leaving a lasting mark on the world and allies. Experience a narrative of change, continuity, and the remnants of the Precursors' lost civilization.
