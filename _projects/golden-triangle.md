# The Golden Triangle

This is a living document chronicling the development and running of a Stars Without Number campaign setting. The documentation aims to be comprehensive while maintaining readability and usefulness for other game masters.

<div class="sidenote">
The name "Golden Triangle" refers both to the triangular power structure of the major factions and to the ancient Southeast Asian region of the same name, which inspired certain cultural elements.
