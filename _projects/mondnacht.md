## About the Project

Created in collaboration with Lukas Krieg and Leon Noel, _Mondnacht_ explores themes of romanticism and space exploration through an interactive narrative. The game transforms a classical German poem into a contemporary sci-fi experience, challenging players to discover new meanings in familiar verses.

### Features
- Interactive retelling of Eichendorff's "Mondnacht"
- Blend of classical poetry and science fiction elements
- Atmospheric text-based gameplay

## Development

This experimental piece was developed during the first Naranauten Game Jam in approximately 10 hours. Using Twine as our storytelling platform, we focused on creating an experience that would honor both the source material and our science fiction vision.

## Recognition
First Place Winner - Naranauten Game Jam
